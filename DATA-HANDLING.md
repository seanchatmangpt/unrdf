# Data Handling and Privacy Policy

## Overview

This document outlines how the UNRDF KGC (Knowledge Graph Control) JavaScript Sidecar handles data, including privacy considerations, data retention, and compliance with applicable regulations.

## Data Types

### 1. Knowledge Graph Data

**What it is**: RDF triples, SPARQL queries, SHACL shapes, and other semantic web data processed by the sidecar.

**How it's handled**:
- **Processing**: Data is processed in-memory during transaction execution
- **Storage**: No persistent storage by default (configurable)
- **Transmission**: Data may be transmitted between components during processing
- **Retention**: No automatic retention (configurable)

**Privacy considerations**:
- Knowledge graph data may contain sensitive information
- Users should ensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations
- Consider data classification and access controls

### 2. Transaction Receipts

**What it is**: Cryptographic receipts containing transaction metadata, hashes, and execution results.

- **Generation**: Created for every transaction
- **Storage**: Stored in lockchain (if enabled) for audit purposes
- **Transmission**: May be transmitted to observability systems
- **Retention**: Retained according to audit requirements

**Privacy considerations**:
- Receipts contain metadata but not the actual data content
- Cryptographic hashes provide integrity without exposing content
- Consider retention policies for audit compliance

### 3. Performance Metrics

**What it is**: System performance data including latency, throughput, error rates, and resource usage.

**How it's handled**:
- **Collection**: Automatically collected during operation
- **Storage**: Stored in memory and exported to observability systems

**Privacy considerations**:
- Metrics are aggregated and do not contain individual data points
- Consider anonymization for sensitive environments
- Review data retention policies

### 4. Log Data

**What it is**: Structured logs containing execution traces, error messages, and diagnostic information.

**How it's handled**:
- **Generation**: Created during operation
- **Storage**: Stored locally and/or transmitted to log aggregation systems
- **Transmission**: May be transmitted to external logging systems
- **Retention**: Configurable retention periods

**Privacy considerations**:
- Logs may contain sensitive information
- Implement log sanitization and filtering
