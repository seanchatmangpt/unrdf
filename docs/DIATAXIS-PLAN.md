# UNRDF Diataxis Documentation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for implementing **full Diataxis documentation** across all 17 UNRDF packages. Diataxis is a four-part framework that organizes documentation into distinct types: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, and Explanation.

**Current State:** Root-level docs exist with some Diataxis structure, but 17 packages have inconsistent, incomplete documentation.

**Goal:** Every package has complete, well-organized documentation following Diataxis principles by Q2 2025.

**Impact:**
- 🎯 Users find answers faster
- 👥 Contributors understand code better
- 🔄 Maintainability improves
- 📈 Adoption increases

---

## What is Diataxis?

Diataxis is a documentation framework by Daniele Procida that organizes docs into four quadrants:

```
                    THEORY ←→ PRACTICE
                       ↑
                       |
         TUTORIALS    |    HOW-TO GUIDES
      (Learning)      |    (Problem-solving)
  ────────────────────┼────────────────────
  (Understanding)     |     (Information)
     EXPLANATION      |      REFERENCE
                       |
                       ↓
```

| Type | Purpose | Audience | Question Asked |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Tutorials** | Learning by doing | Newcomers | "How do I get started?" |
| **How-To Guides** | Solving specific problems | Working developers | "How do I do X?" |
| **Reference** | Complete information | Active users | "What does this do?" |
| **Explanation** | Understanding concepts | Curious learners | "Why does it work this way?" |

**Key Principle:** Each type serves a different need. Don't mix them (e.g., API reference shouldn't teach concepts).

## Current State Assessment

### 📊 Coverage by Package

| Package | README | docs/ | API.md | GUIDE.md | Status |
|---------|:------:|:-----:|:------:|:--------:|--------|
| @unrdf/core | ✅ | ✅ | 📄 (4.1K) | 📄 | Most developed |
| @unrdf/hooks | ✅ | ✅ | 📄 | 📄 | Strong (PhD thesis) |
| @unrdf/browser | ✅ | ✅ | 📋 TODO | 📋 TODO | Needs content |
| @unrdf/cli | ✅ | ✅ | 📋 TODO | 📋 TODO | Needs content |

| @unrdf/dark-matter | ✅ | ✅ | 📋 TODO | 📋 TODO | Needs content |
| @unrdf/project-engine | ✅ | ✅ | 📋 TODO | 📋 TODO | Needs content |
| @unrdf/oxigraph | ✅ | ❌ | — | — | Needs docs/ |
| @unrdf/react | ✅ | ❌ | — | — | Needs docs/ |
| @unrdf/engine-gateway | ✅ | ❌ | — | — | Needs docs/ |
| @unrdf/domain | ✅ | ❌ | — | — | Private (minimal OK) |
| @unrdf/test-utils | ✅ | ❌ | — | — | Private (minimal OK) |
| @unrdf/validation | ✅ | ❌ | — | — | Private (minimal OK) |

**Summary:**
- 100% have README ✅
- 53% have docs/ directory
- 8/9 with docs/ have incomplete API.md and GUIDE.md files
- No package has structured Diataxis layout

### 🎯 Current Gaps

1. **No tutorials** at package level (only root /examples/)
2. **Stub API files** need real content from JSDoc
3. **No task-oriented guides** per package
4. **No troubleshooting** sections
5. **Private packages** (domain, test-utils, validation) are undocumented
6. **Inconsistent structure** across packages
7. **No cross-package workflows** documented
8. **Examples disconnected** from docs

## Content Guidelines

### Tutorial Writing

**Tone:** Friendly, encouraging, hands-on

**Structure:**
1. **Why this matters** (1 sentence)
2. **What you'll build** (1-2 sentences)
3. **Prerequisites** (list)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** (numbered)
5. **Verify it works** (how to test)
6. **What's next** (next tutorial to read)

**Example template:**
```markdown
# Tutorial: Your First SPARQL Query

This tutorial will teach you how to query RDF data.

## What You'll Learn
- Parse RDF data
- Write a SPARQL query
- Read results

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

## Step 1: Create a file

```bash
npm init
npm install @unrdf/core
```

```

### How-To Writing

**Tone:** Direct, practical, problem-focused

**Structure:**
1. **Problem statement** (what problem?)
2. **Prerequisites** (what you need)
3. **Solution** (code + explanation)
4. **Variations** (alternative approaches)
5. **See also** (related guides)

**Example:**
```markdown

[code example]

## See Also
- [Performance Tuning Guide]
- [SPARQL Execution]
```

### Reference Writing

**Tone:** Formal, complete, precise

**Structure:**
1. **Overview** (what is this?)
2. **Quick example** (minimal working example)
3. **Detailed sections** (all options/methods)
4. **Parameters** (types, defaults)
5. **Examples** (common use cases)
6. **See also** (related references)

### Explanation Writing

**Tone:** Educational, conceptual, exploratory

**Structure:**
1. **Big picture** (context)
2. **How it works** (mechanism)
3. **Why this way** (design rationale)
4. **Real-world analogy** (comparison)
5. **When to use** (applicability)

---

## Automation & Tools

### JSDoc → Reference Extraction

Create `scripts/generate-api-reference.js`:

```javascript
// Parse JSDoc comments from src/ files
// Generate API.md with:
// - All exported functions
// - Parameters & return types
// - Code examples from @example tags
// - Links to source files

// Usage: pnpm run generate-api-ref --package @unrdf/core
```

### Template Generation

Create `scripts/init-package-docs.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./scripts/init-package-docs.sh @unrdf/core

PACKAGE=$1
mkdir -p packages/${PACKAGE#@unrdf/}/docs/{TUTORIALS,HOW-TO,REFERENCE,EXPLANATION}

# Copy templates
cp docs/_templates/INDEX.md packages/${PACKAGE#@unrdf/}/docs/
cp docs/_templates/*.md packages/${PACKAGE#@unrdf/}/docs/*/

echo "✅ Initialized docs for $PACKAGE"
echo "📍 Next: Fill in content in packages/${PACKAGE#@unrdf/}/docs/"
```

### Diataxis Validation

Create `scripts/validate-diataxis.js`:

```javascript
// Checks each package for:
// - Has all 4 directories (TUTORIALS, HOW-TO, REFERENCE, EXPLANATION)
// - Each has README.md
// - Has minimum content (not just stubs)
// - Links are valid
// - Tone matches Diataxis guidelines

// Usage: pnpm run validate:diataxis
```

### Navigation Strategy

**Main entry point:** New `docs/DIATAXIS-MAP.md`

```markdown
# UNRDF Documentation Map

## Quick Links
- **New to UNRDF?** → [Tutorials](./TUTORIALS/)
- **Building something?** → [How-To Guides](./HOW-TO/)
- **Looking up API?** → [Reference](./REFERENCE/)
- **Learning concepts?** → [Explanation](./EXPLANATION/)

## By Package
[Table of all packages with their Diataxis docs]

## By Task
[Index of tutorials and how-tos by use case]
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **High effort, low ROI** | Start with high-impact packages (core, hooks) |
| **Content becomes stale** | Automated validation + contributor guidelines |
| **Inconsistent tone** | Style guide + peer review process |
| **Duplication** | Cross-reference, don't duplicate |
| **Too much content** | Use Diataxis as filter (one per type) |
| **Missing examples** | Generate from tests/examples/ |

---

## Success Story

After full Diataxis implementation, users will:

✅ **New users:** "I got started in 10 minutes with the tutorial"

✅ **Active users:** "I found exactly how to do X with the how-to guide"

✅ **Developers:** "The API reference is complete and clear"

✅ **Contributors:** "The explanation helped me understand why it's designed this way"

✅ **Search:** "Google knows about each page and I found my answer"

---

## Next Steps

1. **Approve this plan** → Get buy-in from team
2. **Create templates** → Phase 1
3. **Staff the effort** → Assign package owners
4. **Set up automation** → JSDoc extraction, validation scripts
5. **Write core docs** → Phase 2
6. **Iterate & expand** → Phases 3-6
7. **Measure impact** → Track metrics, gather feedback

---

## Appendix: Diataxis Cheat Sheet

### When to Write What Type

**Tutorial:** User is new and wants to **learn by doing**
- Goal: Get them "unstuck" quickly
- Success: They complete a working example
- Question: "How do I get started?"

**How-To:** User has a **specific problem to solve**
- Goal: Give them the solution directly
- Success: They solve their problem faster
- Question: "How do I do X?"

**Reference:** User needs **complete information**
- Goal: Be comprehensive and precise
- Success: They find exactly what they need
- Question: "What does this do?"

**Explanation:** User wants to **understand concepts**
- Goal: Increase understanding, not solve a problem
- Success: They understand *why* things work this way
- Question: "Why does it work like this?"

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Tutorial that explains concepts** → Split into tutorial + explanation
❌ **Reference trying to teach** → Move pedagogy to explanation/tutorial
❌ **How-to that's a mini-tutorial** → Keep it solution-focused
❌ **Explanation with step-by-step code** → Use a tutorial instead
