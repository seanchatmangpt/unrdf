## Multi-Venue Strategy

### Avoiding Self-Competition

Do NOT submit overlapping content to:
- VLDB and SIGMOD in same cycle (database venues)
- ICSE and FSE in same cycle (SE venues)
- BPM and CAiSE in same cycle (IS venues)

### Complementary Submissions

Submit to venues with different audiences:
```
Thesis 1 (VLDB) + Thesis 4 (ICSE) = OK (different communities)
Thesis 2 (BPM) + Thesis 3 (S&P) = OK (different communities)
```

### Journal Extensions

After conference acceptance, extend to journals:
| Conference Paper | Target Journal | Timeline |
|------------------|----------------|----------|
| VLDB paper | VLDB Journal | 12 months post |
| BPM paper | IS Journal | 18 months post |
| ICSE paper | TSE | 12 months post |
| S&P paper | TOPS | 18 months post |
