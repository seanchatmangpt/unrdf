# Collective Intelligence Protocol

## Swarm Objectives Hierarchy

### PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: 80%+ Test Pass Rate
**Target**: Achieve 80% test pass rate (currently ~70% based on test output)
**Gap**: ~56 failing tests out of ~200 total tests
**Priority**: CRITICAL - This is the unified convergence metric

### SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: Maintain Backward Compatibility
**Target**: No breaking changes to existing API surface
**Status**: STABLE - Core APIs unchanged
**Priority**: HIGH

### TERTIARY OBJECTIVE: Optimize Performance
**Target**: Meet KGC PRD performance metrics (p50 ≤ 200µs, p99 ≤ 2ms)
**Status**: PARTIAL - Some optimizations needed
**Priority**: MEDIUM

### QUATERNARY OBJECTIVE: Improve Code Quality
**Target**: Maintain clean architecture and test coverage
**Status**: GOOD - Architecture documented, tests comprehensive
**Priority**: LOW

## Agent Specializations

**Role**: Architecture & design decisions
**Expertise**: System design, component interactions, deployment patterns
**Responsibilities**:
- Define component boundaries and interfaces
- Design scalability and reliability patterns
- Create architectural decision records
- Validate system coherence

### perf-analyzer
**Role**: Performance optimization & profiling
**Expertise**: Latency optimization, throughput analysis, resource utilization
**Responsibilities**:
- Profile performance bottlenecks
- Recommend optimization strategies
- Validate performance targets
- Monitor resource consumption

### code-analyzer
**Role**: Code quality & test infrastructure
**Expertise**: Test patterns, code quality, refactoring
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze test failures and patterns
- Identify code smells and anti-patterns
- Recommend refactoring strategies
- Validate test coverage

### sparc-coord
**Role**: Methodology & quality gates
**Expertise**: SPARC methodology, quality assurance, process validation
**Responsibilities**:
- Enforce SPARC phases (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)
- Define quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Coordinate cross-agent workflows
- Validate methodology compliance

### collective-intelligence-coordinator (Meta-Coordinator)
**Role**: Swarm orchestration and consensus building
**Expertise**: Distributed decision-making, knowledge synthesis, conflict resolution
**Responsibilities**:
- Synthesize agent findings into unified recommendations
- Build consensus on critical decisions
- Monitor swarm convergence metrics
- Detect emergent patterns and synergies

## Decision-Making Protocol

### Consensus Required (Architecture Changes)
**Process**:
1. Proposal creation by system-architect
2. Impact analysis by perf-analyzer
3. Implementation feasibility by code-analyzer
4. Methodology validation by sparc-coord
5. Collective vote with weighted scoring
6. Meta-coordinator synthesizes final decision

**Consensus Threshold**: 75% agreement weighted by expertise

**Example Decision**: KGC Sidecar communication strategy
- Option A: Full gRPC rewrite with circuit breaker
- Option B: HTTP REST fallback with gRPC primary
- Option C: Local-only mode with optional sidecar

### Majority Vote (Implementation Approach)
**Process**:
1. Options presented by proposing agent
2. Each agent provides vote + rationale
3. Simple majority (>50%) wins
4. Meta-coordinator breaks ties

**Example Decision**: Performance optimization priority
- Option A: SPARQL query optimization (highest impact)
- Option B: Store caching (medium impact)
- Option C: Streaming parsers (lower impact)

### Individual Autonomy (Tactical Optimizations)
**Process**:
1. Agent identifies optimization opportunity
2. Agent implements if within scope
3. Agent reports to collective memory
4. Meta-coordinator validates coherence

**Example Decision**: Local code refactoring, test helper creation

### Coordinator Override (Conflicting Objectives)
**Process**:
1. Conflict detected by meta-coordinator
2. Priority hierarchy consulted
3. Meta-coordinator resolves based on PRIMARY objective
4. Override decision logged with rationale

**Example Conflict**: Performance optimization vs test coverage
**Resolution**: Prioritize test pass rate (PRIMARY) over optimization (TERTIARY)

## Knowledge Sharing

### Distributed Memory Architecture
**Storage**: Claude-Flow memory system with namespaced keys
**Namespaces**:
- `swarm/architecture/*`: Architecture decisions and patterns
- `swarm/perf/*`: Performance metrics and optimizations
- `swarm/quality/*`: Code quality and test findings
- `swarm/sparc/*`: Methodology and process validation
- `swarm/collective/*`: Unified knowledge and consensus decisions

### Cross-Agent Learning Protocol
**Mechanism**:
1. Each agent stores findings in distributed memory
2. Meta-coordinator retrieves all agent outputs
3. Pattern recognition identifies synergies
4. Unified knowledge graph created
5. All agents consume collective insights

**Example Learning**:
- perf-analyzer identifies slow SPARQL queries
- code-analyzer identifies test pattern matching issues
- system-architect proposes query optimization + test helpers
- Emergent insight: Single solution addresses both problems

### Pattern Recognition
**Automated Detection**:
- Recurring error patterns across tests
- Performance bottlenecks correlating with test failures
- Architectural decisions impacting multiple concerns
- Test coverage gaps exposing real bugs

**Manual Synthesis**:
- Meta-coordinator reviews all agent findings
- Identifies non-obvious connections
- Proposes compound solutions
- Validates through agent consensus

### Collective Problem-Solving
**Complex Issues Requiring Multi-Agent Coordination**:
1. **Test Infrastructure Overhaul**:
   - code-analyzer: Identify failing test patterns
   - system-architect: Design test helper framework
   - perf-analyzer: Ensure helpers don't degrade performance
   - sparc-coord: Validate against TDD methodology

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - perf-analyzer: Profile and identify bottlenecks
   - system-architect: Design optimization architecture
   - code-analyzer: Implement refactoring
   - sparc-coord: Validate against performance targets

3. **Sidecar Integration**:
   - system-architect: Design communication patterns
   - code-analyzer: Implement integration tests
   - perf-analyzer: Validate latency targets
   - sparc-coord: Ensure methodology compliance
