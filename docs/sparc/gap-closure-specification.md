- Parse Errors: 1 test file (security-authorization.test.mjs)
- Test Pass Rate: ~90%

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: KGC Sidecar Unavailability Handling
**Priority:** P0
**Description:** The system must handle KGC sidecar unavailability gracefully without blocking host application operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-1.1: Implement circuit breaker pattern for sidecar communication
- AC-1.2: Health check endpoint responds within 100ms
- AC-1.3: Local fallback mode activated when sidecar unreachable
- AC-1.4: Circuit breaker opens after 3 consecutive failures
- AC-1.5: Circuit breaker half-open state with gradual recovery
- AC-1.6: Comprehensive metrics for sidecar availability

**Technical Approach:**
```javascript
// Circuit breaker implementation
const circuitBreaker = {
  state: 'closed', // closed, open, half-open
  failureCount: 0,
  failureThreshold: 3,
  resetTimeout: 30000, // 30s
  check: async () => {
    // Health check logic with 100ms timeout
  },
  execute: async (operation, fallback) => {
    if (state === 'open') return fallback();
    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      return fallback();
    }
  }
};
```

### FR-2: Hook Evaluation Performance Optimization
**Priority:** P0
**Description:** Hook evaluation must complete within performance targets to meet KGC PRD requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-2.1: p50 pre-hook pipeline ≤ 200µs
- AC-2.2: p99 pre-hook pipeline ≤ 2ms
- AC-2.3: Hook execution rate ≥ 10,000 exec/min sustained
- AC-2.4: Receipt write ≤ 5ms median (no canonicalization)
- AC-2.5: Memory usage remains bounded under load
- AC-2.6: Zero performance regressions from baseline

**Technical Approach:**
```
ALGORITHM: HookEvaluationOptimization
INPUT: hook_definition, rdf_data
OUTPUT: evaluation_result

1. PARSE hook_definition ONCE (cache parsed hook)
2. IF SPARQL query:
     2a. COMPILE query (cache compiled query)
     2b. USE streaming query execution
     2c. SHORT-CIRCUIT on first result (ASK queries)
     2d. LIMIT result set size (COUNT queries)
3. IF SHACL validation:
     3a. USE incremental validation (only changed triples)
     3b. CACHE validation results by content hash
     3c. PARALLEL validation for independent shapes
4. RETURN result within <2ms p99
```

### FR-3: Test Suite Stability and Correctness
**Priority:** P0
**Description:** All tests must parse without syntax errors and pass consistently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-3.1: Zero test files with parse errors
- AC-3.2: Test pass rate ≥ 95% (505/531 tests)
- AC-3.3: Zero flaky tests (consistent results across runs)
- AC-3.4: All critical path tests passing (100%)
- AC-3.5: Test execution time < 30 minutes for full suite
- AC-3.6: Coverage thresholds met (95% statements, 90% branches)

**Issues to Resolve:**
1. **Parse Error:** `security-authorization.test.mjs` - Expression expected
2. **System Integration Tests:** External service mocking failures
3. **Business Logic Tests:** Undefined SPARQL query results
4. **Configuration Tests:** Conflicting configuration option handling
5. **Testing & QA Tests:** Coverage gap detection logic

### FR-4: OTEL Trace Export to Jaeger
**Priority:** P1
**Description:** OpenTelemetry traces must export successfully to Jaeger for production observability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-4.1: OTEL traces export to Jaeger endpoint
- AC-4.2: Distributed tracing across transaction lifecycle
- AC-4.3: Trace correlation IDs maintained throughout
- AC-4.4: Performance metrics integrated with traces
- AC-4.5: Error spans marked with appropriate status codes
- AC-4.6: Trace sampling configuration documented

**Technical Approach:**
```javascript
// OTEL Jaeger exporter configuration
const observabilityConfig = {
  enableTracing: true,
  enableMetrics: true,
  serviceName: 'unrdf-kgc',
  endpoint: process.env.OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT || 'http://jaeger:14268/api/traces',
  sampling: {
    type: 'always_on', // or 'probability' with rate
    rate: 1.0
  }
};
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Test Pass Rate Target
**Description:** Maintain high test pass rate for production readiness
**Target:** ≥ 95% test pass rate (505/531 tests passing)
**Current:** ~90% (480/531 tests passing)
**Gap:** +25 tests need fixes

### NFR-2: API Backward Compatibility
**Description:** Zero breaking changes to existing APIs
**Validation:** Contract tests for all public interfaces
**Migration Path:** Deprecation warnings for 1 major version

### NFR-3: Configuration Backward Compatibility
**Description:** All existing configurations remain valid
**Validation:** Configuration schema versioning
**Default Values:** Safe defaults for new options

### NFR-4: Performance Improvement Measurability
**Description:** Performance improvements must be quantifiable
**Metrics:**
- Baseline vs. optimized latency comparison
- Throughput improvement percentage
- Memory usage reduction percentage
- OTEL metrics for continuous monitoring

## Constraints

### CON-1: External Dependency Immutability
**Description:** Cannot modify external dependencies (N3.js, rdflib, etc.)
**Approach:** Adapter pattern for wrapping external APIs
**Testing:** Mock external dependencies in tests

### CON-2: Cleanroom Environment Compatibility
**Description:** Must work in isolated environments without external services
**Approach:**
- Fallback modes for all external integrations
- Mock implementations for testing
- Configuration flags for cleanroom mode

### CON-3: Database Schema Stability
**Description:** No database schema changes allowed
**Validation:** Schema migration scripts tested in staging
**Rollback:** Backward-compatible schema changes only

## Test Infrastructure Requirements

### TIR-1: Parse Error Resolution
**File:** `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/security-authorization.test.mjs`
**Error:** "Expression expected"
**Root Cause:** Syntax error in test file
**Fix:** Correct syntax and validate with ESLint

### TIR-2: External Service Mocking
**Tests:** System integration, business logic domain
**Issue:** Undefined SPARQL query results
**Fix:** Implement proper mock SPARQL endpoint responses

### TIR-3: Configuration Validation
**Tests:** Configuration and deployment
**Issue:** Conflicting configuration options not detected
**Fix:** Implement Zod schema cross-field validation

### TIR-4: Test Data Management
