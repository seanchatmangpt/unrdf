# UNRDF v3 Acceptance Criteria & Validation Strategy

**Version**: 3.0.0
**Status**: Definition Phase (No Implementation Yet)
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Agent**: Hive Mind Swarm - Tester
**Session**: swarm-1759372550979-hjdkceydw

## Executive Summary

This document defines **acceptance criteria and validation strategy** for the UNRDF v3 release. Based on the 80/20 principle, it identifies **critical capabilities** that must work for v3 launch and **validation methods** to ensure production readiness.

### Key Principles

1. **Tests Are Truth** - Only trust `npm test` results, not agent claims
2. **OTEL Validates Behavior** - OpenTelemetry metrics are the second source of truth
3. **80/20 Focus** - 20% of features deliver 80% of value
4. **Fail-Fast** - No complex fallback mechanisms
5. **Production-Grade Only** - Every capability must meet performance SLOs

---

## 1. Critical Path: The 20% That Matters

### 1.1 Enterprise Capabilities (P0 - Must Ship)

Based on launch checklist and 80/20 analysis, these capabilities deliver **85% of enterprise value**:

#### A. Dark Matter 80/20 Framework (35% Value Weight)

**What It Must Do:**
- Identify critical 20% of RDF queries that deliver 80% of performance
- Optimize query execution with intelligent rewriting (6 optimization rules)
- Validate performance targets using Zod schemas
- Generate OTEL observability spans for all operations
- Execute within performance SLOs (p50 < 150µs, p99 < 2ms)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```bash
# Criterion 1: All 18 Dark Matter tests must pass
npm run test:dark-matter
# Expected: ✅ Tests 18 passed (18)
# Expected: Duration < 5s
# Expected: Zero OTEL errors

# Criterion 2: Performance targets validated
grep "performanceTargets" test/dark-matter-80-20.test.mjs
# Expected: Zod schema validation working
# Expected: p50PreHookPipeline: 0.2ms
# Expected: p99PreHookPipeline: 2ms

# Criterion 3: 85% value delivery ratio
# Expected: metrics.valueDeliveryRatio >= 0.8
# Expected: 6 core components initialized
# Expected: Zero optional components required
```

**Validation Method:**
1. Run `npm run test:dark-matter`
2. Check `grep "FAIL\|Error\|×" test-output.log` (must be empty)
3. Verify OTEL metrics: `grep "Error recorded" .claude-flow/metrics/*.json` (must be empty)
4. Validate performance: p50 < 150µs, p99 < 2ms

### 1.2 Strategic Deferrals (The 80% for Later)

These features deliver **15% of value** and are deferred to v3.1+:

#### Deferred: Monaco Editor Polish (5% Value)
- **Current State**: Basic hook management UI exists
- **Missing**: Advanced auto-completion, syntax validation, real-time SPARQL linting
- **Impact**: Low - manual hook editing works
- **Timeline**: v3.1-v3.2 (incremental improvements)
- **Tests**: 60 tests created but skipped (implementation missing)

#### Deferred: Full CLI v2 Parity (10% Value)
- **Current State**: 8 P0 commands working (80% of usage)
- **Missing**: 48 advanced commands (query advanced, parse advanced, graph advanced)
- **Impact**: Medium - core workflows functional
- **Timeline**: v3.1-v3.3 (iterative over 4-6 weeks)

#### Deferred: N3 Reasoning Engine (3% Value)
- **Current State**: 23 tests failing due to EyeReasoner/Vite incompatibility
- **Missing**: N3 rule-based reasoning support
- **Impact**: Low - affects <1% of use cases
- **Timeline**: v3.1 (Q1 2026, pending Vite/Rollup fix)
- **Workaround**: Use external reasoner

#### Deferred: CLI Startup Optimization (7% Value)
- **Current State**: 487ms startup time

## 3. Test Strategy (for Later Implementation)

### 3.1 Test Pyramid (80/20 Applied)

```
         /\
        /E2E\      <- 5% of tests, 20% of bugs caught
       /------\
      /Integr. \   <- 15% of tests, 30% of bugs caught
     /----------\
    /   Unit     \ <- 80% of tests, 50% of bugs caught
   /--------------\
```

**80/20 Principle Applied to Testing:**
- **Unit Tests (80%)**: Fast, isolated, 95%+ coverage
- **Integration Tests (15%)**: API workflows, service integration
- **E2E Tests (5%)**: Critical user flows only

### 3.2 Test Categorization

#### Category 1: Smoke Tests (Run First, Fail Fast)

**Purpose**: Validate core functionality before detailed testing

**Tests:**
1. Dark Matter 18/18 passing
2. Sidecar commands execute (4/4)
3. CLI v2 P0 commands work (8+)
4. CI/CD workflows valid (3/3)

**Execution Time**: <5 minutes
**Acceptance**: 100% must pass

#### Category 2: Integration Tests (Core Workflows)

**Purpose**: Validate end-to-end workflows

**Tests:**
1. Transaction lifecycle (create → apply → verify)
2. Hook lifecycle (register → execute → monitor)
3. Policy pack deployment
4. Sidecar monitoring
5. REPL session

**Execution Time**: <15 minutes
**Acceptance**: 100% must pass

#### Category 3: Performance Tests (SLO Validation)

**Purpose**: Ensure performance targets met

**Tests:**
1. Dark Matter p50 < 150µs, p99 < 2ms
2. Transaction p99 < 5ms
3. Hook scheduling < 10ms
4. Sidecar health check < 10ms
5. CLI startup < 500ms (v3.0 acceptable)

**Execution Time**: <30 minutes
**Acceptance**: 4/5 targets met (CLI startup deferred)

#### Category 4: Security Tests (Adversarial)

**Purpose**: Validate security controls

**Tests:**
1. Sandbox isolation (code injection prevention)
2. Input validation (malformed data)
3. Cryptographic verification (receipt tampering)
4. Resource limits (timeout, memory)
5. Dependency audit (zero CRITICAL/HIGH vulns)

**Execution Time**: <20 minutes
**Acceptance**: 100% must pass

#### Category 5: Regression Tests (Prevent Backsliding)

**Purpose**: Ensure existing features still work

**Tests:**
1. All v2 features still functional
2. Backward compatibility (v2 hooks/policies)
3. Migration scripts work
4. API contracts unchanged

**Execution Time**: <30 minutes
**Acceptance**: 100% must pass

---

### 3.3 Test Execution Schedule

```bash
# Phase 1: Smoke Tests (5 minutes)
npm run test:smoke

# Phase 2: Unit Tests (10 minutes)
npm test

# Phase 3: Integration Tests (15 minutes)
npm run test:integration

# Phase 4: E2E Tests (20 minutes)
npm run test:e2e

# Phase 5: Performance Tests (30 minutes)
npm run test:performance

# Phase 6: Security Tests (20 minutes)
npm run test:security

# Total Execution: ~100 minutes (acceptable for CI/CD)
```

**Optimization for 80/20**:
- Run smoke tests first (fail fast)
- Parallelize unit/integration tests
- Cache test results
- Skip E2E if smoke tests fail

---

## 4. Validation Methods (The Protocols)

### 4.1 The Validation Protocol (MANDATORY)

**NEVER accept agent reports without validation. ALWAYS:**

#### Step 1: Run Tests
```bash
npm test
npm run test:dark-matter
npm run test:integration
```

#### Step 2: Check for Failures
```bash
grep "FAIL\|Error\|×" test-output.log
# Expected: Empty (no failures)
```

#### Step 3: Verify OTEL Metrics
```bash
grep "Error recorded" .claude-flow/metrics/*.json
# Expected: Empty (no errors logged)
```

#### Step 4: Inspect Source Code
```bash
# Verify files actually exist
ls -la src/knowledge-engine/dark-matter/
ls -la src/cli-v2/commands/sidecar/

# Check implementation quality
cat src/knowledge-engine/dark-matter-core.mjs | grep "class DarkMatterCore"
```

#### Step 5: Compare Reality vs Claims

| Agent Claim | Validation Method | Reality Check |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| "100% test coverage" | `npm test -- --coverage` | Check actual % |
| "Production ready - SHIP IT" | Run tests, check failures | Look for FAIL count |
| "All features working" | Manual execution | Test each command |
| "Performance targets met" | `npm run test:performance` | Check SLO metrics |
| "Zero bugs" | Run tests | Count actual failures |

---

### 4.2 Agent Validation Checklist

**For every agent deliverable, VERIFY:**

- [ ] Tests run successfully (`npm test`)
- [ ] Zero FAIL/Error in output
- [ ] Files actually exist (not just claimed)
- [ ] Code matches specification
- [ ] OTEL metrics clean (no errors)
- [ ] Performance SLOs met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

**ONLY accept work when ALL criteria met.**

---

### 4.3 Common Agent Lies & Counters

| Agent Lie | Reality | Counter-Measure |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| "Monaco Editor complete" | Basic UI exists, tests skipped | Check `describe.skip` in tests |
| "CLI v2 complete" | 8/56 commands working | Count actual files in `commands/` |
| "100% production ready" | 5/18 Dark Matter tests failing | Run `npm run test:dark-matter` |
| "All tests passing" | 51 failures in business logic | `grep "FAIL" test-output.log` |
| "Zero errors" | Errors in OTEL logs | `grep "Error recorded" metrics/*.json` |

**Golden Rule**: **IF YOU ARE NOT SURE, RUN THE TESTS AND OTEL METRICS TO ENSURE AGENTS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR TASKS.**

## 9. Conclusion

This acceptance criteria document defines **WHAT needs validation** for v3 release, not HOW to test. Implementation of tests comes after core functionality is built.

### Key Takeaways

1. **80/20 Focus**: 6 critical capabilities deliver 85% of value
2. **Tests Are Truth**: Only trust `npm test` results
3. **OTEL Validates Behavior**: Metrics are second source of truth
4. **Fail Fast**: Dark Matter, Sidecar, Transactions must work
5. **Strategic Deferrals**: Monaco, CLI parity, N3 reasoning deferred

### Next Steps

1. **Coder Agent**: Implement P0 capabilities (Dark Matter, Sidecar, CLI)
2. **Tester Agent**: Create tests AFTER implementation (not before)
3. **Reviewer Agent**: Validate against acceptance criteria
4. **DevOps Agent**: Configure CI/CD pipeline
5. **Launch Coordinator**: Execute launch checklist
