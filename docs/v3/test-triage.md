# Test Triage Report - UNRDF v3

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Analyst**: Production Validator Agent
**Test Run**: npm test (Vitest 1.6.1)
**Total Test Files**: 71
**Total Failures**: ~106 tests

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES**: The v3 release is blocked by approximately 106 failing tests across multiple categories. The failures fall into three main categories:

1. **P0 - Critical Blockers** (26 tests): Import/dependency failures that cascade to other tests
2. **P1 - Important** (55 tests): Security, data integrity, and system integration failures
3. **P2 - Nice to Have** (25 tests): Configuration, compliance, and meta-testing failures

**Estimated Fix Time**: 8-16 hours for P0+P1, following 80/20 principle

---

## P0 - Critical Blockers (26 tests) üî¥

### 1. Reasoning Engine Import Failure (23 tests)

**Root Cause**: eyereasoner package import issue in `src/knowledge-engine/reason.mjs`

**File**: `src/knowledge-engine/reason.mjs:9`
```javascript
// BROKEN
const { n3reasoner } = eyereasonerPkg;

// Error: n3reasoner is not a function
```

**Impact**: Blocks ALL reasoning functionality
- 23/23 reasoning tests failing
- Complete failure of N3 rule-based inference
- Blocks production deployment of reasoning features

**Failing Tests**:
```
test/knowledge-engine/reason.test.mjs:
  √ó should perform basic reasoning
  √ó should include original data by default
  √ó should exclude original data when requested
  √ó should handle reasoning options
  √ó should handle empty store
  √ó should handle complex reasoning scenarios
  √ó should handle reasoning with no applicable rules
  √ó reasonMultiple > should reason with multiple rule sets
  √ó reasonMultiple > should handle empty rules list
  √ó reasonMultiple > should handle reasoning options
  √ó extractInferred > should extract only inferred quads
  √ó extractInferred > should handle case with no inferred quads
  √ó getReasoningStats > should return reasoning statistics
  √ó getReasoningStats > should handle case with no inference
  √ó validateRules > should handle empty rules
  √ó createReasoningSession > should perform reasoning in session
  √ó createReasoningSession > should provide session statistics
  √ó edge cases > should handle reasoning with large datasets
  √ó edge cases > should handle reasoning with complex rule chains
  √ó edge cases > should handle reasoning with conflicting rules
  √ó edge cases > should handle concurrent reasoning operations
  √ó edge cases > should handle reasoning with blank nodes
  √ó edge cases > should handle reasoning with different datatypes
```

**80/20 Priority**: üî• **HIGHEST** - Single fix resolves 23 tests

**Proposed Fix**:
```javascript
// Check eyereasoner package.json exports
// Likely need: import eyereasoner from 'eyereasoner';
// Or: import { n3reasoner } from 'eyereasoner/n3reasoner';
```

### 2. Transaction Hook Management (3 tests)

**Root Cause**: Transaction hook system not implemented or improperly integrated

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/transaction.test.mjs`

**Failing Tests**:
```
√ó addHook > should add a pre-hook
√ó addHook > should add a post-hook
√ó addHook > should add multiple hooks
√ó removeHook > should remove a hook
√ó apply > should apply a simple transaction
√ó getStats > should return transaction statistics
√ó edge cases > should handle large transactions
√ó edge cases > should handle post-hooks with errors
```

**Impact**: Transaction integrity compromised

**80/20 Priority**: üî• **HIGH** - Core transaction functionality

---

## P1 - Important Security & Integration (55 tests) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Security Authorization (15 tests)

**Root Cause**: Security validation throwing errors instead of preventing execution

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/security-authorization.test.mjs`

**Failing Tests**:
```
Path Traversal (4 tests):
  √ó should prevent directory traversal attacks
    ‚Üí Security validation failed: Path traversal detected, System path access detected
  √ó should prevent absolute path attacks
  √ó should prevent URL encoding bypass attacks
  √ó should prevent null byte injection attacks

Privilege Escalation (2 tests):
  √ó should prevent hook from accessing system resources
    ‚Üí expected true to be false (hook executed when it shouldn't)
  √ó should prevent hook from modifying system configuration

Information Disclosure (3 tests):
  √ó should prevent sensitive information disclosure in error messages
  √ó should prevent stack trace disclosure
  √ó should prevent environment variable disclosure

DoS Prevention (4 tests):
  √ó should prevent CPU exhaustion attacks
  √ó should prevent memory exhaustion attacks
  √ó should prevent file descriptor exhaustion attacks
  √ó should prevent network resource exhaustion attacks

Input Validation (2 tests):
  √ó should validate hook metadata for malicious content
  √ó should validate file URIs for malicious patterns
  √ó should validate SPARQL queries for dangerous operations
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Path traversal: Security validation is working (logs show "Security validation failed") BUT tests expect exceptions to be thrown, not silent failures
- DoS: No resource limits implemented on hook execution
- Information disclosure: Error messages exposing sensitive data

**80/20 Priority**: üî• **HIGH** - Critical security vulnerabilities

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Modify security validation to throw exceptions instead of returning validation results
2. Add resource limits (CPU, memory, file descriptors) to hook sandbox
3. Sanitize error messages to remove sensitive information

---

### 2. System Integration (9 tests)

**Root Cause**: External service failure handling not implemented

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/system-integration.test.mjs`

**Failing Tests**:
```
External Service Failures (3 tests):
  √ó should handle external API service unavailability
    ‚Üí expected undefined to be 3 (retry count)
  √ó should handle database connection failures
    ‚Üí expected undefined to be true
  √ó should handle third-party service integration failures
    ‚Üí Target cannot be null or undefined

API Rate Limiting (2 tests):
  √ó should handle API rate limit enforcement
    ‚Üí Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'rateLimitingEffective')
  √ó should implement rate limiting with different strategies
    ‚Üí Cannot convert undefined or null to object

Network Partition Scenarios (2 tests):
  √ó should handle network partitions and split-brain scenarios
  √ó should handle network latency and timeout scenarios

Service Discovery (1 test):
  √ó should handle service discovery and registration failures

Load Balancer (1 test):
  √ó should handle load balancer failures and failover
```

**Root Cause**: Missing implementation of:
- Retry logic for external services
- Rate limiting middleware
- Network partition detection
- Service discovery integration

**80/20 Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM** - Important for production but can be deferred

---

### 3. Edge Case Data Scenarios (11 tests)

**Root Cause**: Graph analysis and data handling not implemented

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/edge-case-data-scenarios.test.mjs`

**Failing Tests**:
```
Empty Graphs (3 tests):
  √ó should handle completely empty RDF graphs
    ‚Üí Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isEmpty')

Circular References (3 tests):
  √ó should handle simple circular references
    ‚Üí Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hasCycles')
  √ó should handle complex circular reference chains
  √ó should handle self-referencing nodes

Unicode Normalization (2 tests):
  √ó should handle different Unicode normalization forms
    ‚Üí Invalid knowledge hook definition: when.ref.sha256: String must contain exactly 64 character(s)

Timezone Handling (2 tests):
  √ó should handle different timezone representations
  √ó should handle daylight saving time transitions

Floating-Point Precision (1 test):
  √ó should handle floating-point precision in numeric literals
```

**Root Cause**: Missing implementation of:
- Graph analysis utilities (isEmpty, hasCycles, etc.)
- Unicode normalization in SHA256 calculation
- Timezone handling in RDF literals
- Floating-point precision validation

**80/20 Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM** - Data integrity important but not blocking deployment

---

### 4. Error Handling & Recovery (2 tests)

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/error-handling-recovery.test.mjs`

**Failing Tests**:
```
Partial Transaction Rollback (2 tests):
  √ó should handle partial transaction rollback on hook failure
    ‚Üí expected false to be true
  √ó should handle rollback with dependent operations
    ‚Üí expected [] to have a length of 1
```

**Root Cause**: Transaction rollback mechanism not implemented for hook failures

**80/20 Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM** - Important for data consistency

---

### 5. Data Consistency & Corruption (5 tests)

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/data-consistency-corruption.test.mjs`

**Failing Tests**:
```
Partial Transaction Commits (2 tests):

  √ó should handle API breaking changes
  √ó should handle dependency version conflicts

Deployment Rollback (3 tests):
  √ó should handle rollback to previous hook version

  √ó should handle database schema rollback
```

**Root Cause**: Configuration validation and versioning not implemented

**80/20 Priority**: üìã **LOW** - Nice to have, not blocking deployment

---

### 2. Testing & QA Meta-Tests (5 tests)

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/testing-qa.test.mjs`

**Failing Tests**:
```
√ó should detect test coverage gaps and missing test cases
  ‚Üí expected undefined to be 3
√ó should detect and analyze integration test failures
√ó should identify performance test limitations and bottlenecks
√ó should assess security test coverage and identify gaps
√ó should analyze user acceptance testing results and feedback
```

**Root Cause**: Meta-testing functionality not implemented (tests that test the testing)

**80/20 Priority**: üìã **LOW** - Meta-tests, not core functionality

---

### 3. Business Logic & Domain (6 tests)

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/business-logic-domain.test.mjs`

---

### 5. Performance & Scalability (2 tests)

**File**: `test/knowledge-engine/hooks/performance-scalability.test.mjs`

**Failing Tests**:
```
√ó should handle slow hook execution
