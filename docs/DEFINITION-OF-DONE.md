# Definition of Done - Git Hooks Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

### 1. Hook Files Created
- [x] `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` - Fast tier validation hook
- [x] `scripts/hooks/pre-push` - Full tier validation hook
- [x] Both hooks are executable (`chmod +x`)
- [x] Both hooks use proper shebang (`#!/bin/sh`)

### 2. Installation Script
- [x] `scripts/install-hooks.sh` created
- [x] Script verifies prerequisites (git, pnpm, timeout)
- [x] Script backs up existing hooks
- [x] Script installs hooks with proper permissions
- [x] Script includes self-test validation
- [x] Script provides uninstall option (`--uninstall`)
- [x] Script is executable

### 3. Package.json Integration
- [x] `install-hooks` script added to package.json
- [x] Existing `precommit` script documented
- [x] Husky configuration noted (not actively used)

### 4. Documentation
- [x] `docs/GIT-HOOKS.md` created with complete documentation
- [x] Installation instructions provided
- [x] Hook descriptions and gates documented
- [x] Bypass options documented (with warnings)
- [x] Troubleshooting guide included
- [x] Comparison with gold standards documented

### 5. Best Practices Implementation

#### Error Handling
- [x] Uses `set -e` for error handling
- [x] Proper exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)
- [x] Graceful handling of missing `timeout` command
- [x] Error messages are clear and actionable

#### Performance
- [x] Pre-commit targets <5 seconds
- [x] Pre-push targets <60 seconds
- [x] Timeouts configured for all checks
- [x] Pre-commit only checks staged files (efficient)

#### User Experience
- [x] Clear progress messages with emojis
- [x] Gate-by-gate feedback
- [x] Helpful error messages with fix instructions
- [x] Auto-fix for formatting in pre-commit
- [x] Shows last N lines of output on failure

#### Security & Safety
- [x] Bypass options available but discouraged
- [x] Hooks don't modify files without user consent
- [x] Auto-fix requires re-commit (prevents accidental commits)

### 6. Alignment with Gold Standards

#### chicago-tdd-tools Patterns
- [x] Direct git hooks (not husky)
- [x] Install script in `scripts/` directory
- [x] Bypass environment variables
- [x] Clear error messages
- [x] Documentation in comments

#### ggen Patterns
- [x] Fast tier (pre-commit) and full tier (pre-push)
- [x] Timeout protection
- [x] Gate-based validation
- [x] Comprehensive error output
- [x] Self-test in install script

### 7. JavaScript/Node.js Adaptations
- [x] Uses `pnpm` instead of `cargo make`
- [x] Uses `prettier` for formatting
- [x] Uses `eslint` for linting
- [x] Uses `vitest` for testing
- [x] Checks `.mjs`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.md` files
- [x] Respects `--max-warnings=0` in lint command

### 8. Testing & Verification
- [x] Hooks installed successfully
- [x] Hooks are executable
- [x] Install script runs without errors
- [x] Self-test passes
- [x] Syntax validation passes

### 9. Code Quality
- [x] Hooks follow shell scripting best practices
- [x] Consistent formatting and style
- [x] Clear variable naming
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] No hardcoded paths (uses relative paths)

### 10. Documentation Quality
- [x] Complete installation guide
- [x] Usage instructions
- [x] Troubleshooting section
- [x] Bypass options documented
- [x] Design principles explained
- [x] Comparison with gold standards
