## FAQ

### Q: What's the difference between atoms and compositions?
**A**: **Atoms** are smallest units (e.g., createStore, freezeUniverse). **Compositions** combine atoms (e.g., C2 = createStore + freezeUniverse + VectorClock).
**See**: [CAPABILITY-BASIS.md](./CAPABILITY-BASIS.md) vs. [COMPOSITION-LATTICE.md](./COMPOSITION-LATTICE.md)

---

### Q: How do I know what's proven?
**A**: Every capability has:
1. **Source code** citation (file:line)
2. **Test proof** (path to .test.mjs file)
3. **Verification command** (copy-paste to run)
4. **Expected output** (what success looks like)

**See**: [EVIDENCE-INDEX.md](./EVIDENCE-INDEX.md#quick-lookup)

---

### Q: What's the Pareto frontier?
**A**: **8 of 15 compositions** are Pareto-optimal (no strictly better alternative exists). Focus on these for maximum value.
**See**: [COMPOSITION-LATTICE.md](./COMPOSITION-LATTICE.md#pareto-frontier-analysis)

---

### Q: What's the learning path?
**A**: **4 sequential paths** based on your role:
1. RDF → Time-Travel → Workflows (backend devs)
2. RDF → Policy → Zero-Trust (security teams)
3. RDF → Cross-Runtime → BEAM (researchers)
4. RDF → Analytics (data scientists)

**See**: [INTEGRATION-ROADMAP-80-20.md](./INTEGRATION-ROADMAP-80-20.md#learning-path-sequential)

---

### Q: How do I verify claims?
**A**: Run verification commands in [EVIDENCE-INDEX.md](./EVIDENCE-INDEX.md#verification-checklist).
Example:
```bash
timeout 5s node /home/user/unrdf/packages/oxigraph/test/basic.test.mjs
# Expected: All tests pass
```

---

### Q: What's blocked?
**A**: 3 major gaps:
1. Browser BEAM Clusters (C9) - Erlang distribution incomplete
2. HDIT Integration (C12) - No integration tests
3. ML Composition (C13) - HDIT + ML untested

**See**: [INTEGRATION-ROADMAP-80-20.md](./INTEGRATION-ROADMAP-80-20.md#gaps--blockers-summary)
