## Test Execution Evidence

### ✅ Package: federation (latest% coverage - BELOW 80%)

```
Test Files: 6 passed (6)
Tests: 122 passed (122)
Duration: 406ms

Coverage (v8):
  Lines: latest%    ❌ BELOW 80%
  Branches: latest% ❌ BELOW 80%
  Functions: latest% ❌ BELOW 80%
  Statements: latest% ❌ BELOW 80%

Detailed Coverage:
  consensus-manager.mjs: latest% ❌ CRITICAL GAP
  coordinator.mjs: 84% ✅
  distributed-query.mjs: latest% ✅
  federation-coordinator.mjs: latest% ❌
  health.mjs: 100% ✅
  metrics.mjs: latest% ✅
  peer-manager.mjs: latest% ✅
```

**Analysis**: While individual files like `health.mjs` and `metrics.mjs` achieve 100%/95% coverage, `consensus-manager.mjs` at 19% drags down the package average. **NO THRESHOLDS CONFIGURED** - tests pass despite low coverage.

### ⚠️ Package: hooks (Test Failures Detected)

```
Test Files: 3 total
Tests: 87 total | 32 failed ❌

Failed Tests:
  telemetry.test.mjs: 4 failures
    - should start transaction span
    - should handle very large attribute batches
    - should handle cleanup on teardown
    - should handle concurrent span operations

  file-resolver.test.mjs: 28 failures
    - should resolve relative paths
    - should resolve nested paths
    - should handle absolute paths
    - should handle URI schemes
    - should handle http/https URIs
    - should normalize path separators
    - should handle paths with ..
    - should validate SHA-256 hash format
    [... 20 more failures ...]

Duration: <5s (timeout enforced)
```

**Analysis**: 36% test failure rate (32/87). **NO COVERAGE THRESHOLDS** configured, so coverage % unknown. This package likely has coverage gaps masking bugs.

## Coverage Threshold Audit

### ❌ Packages WITHOUT Thresholds (18/19 = latest%)

**CRITICAL**: These packages can commit code with **0% coverage** and tests will pass:

1. cli
2. composables
3. core
4. dark-matter
5. domain
6. engine-gateway
7. **federation** (verified latest% - should FAIL at 80%)
8. **hooks** (test failures, coverage unknown)
9. kgc-4d
10. kgn
11. knowledge-engine
12. oxigraph
13. project-engine
14. streaming
15. test-utils
16. validation
17. docs
18. browser

### ✅ Configs WITH Thresholds (2 configs)

1. **Root `vitest.config.fast.mjs`** (80/80/80/80) ✅
   - Used for: CI/CD fast testing (80/20 subset)
   - Enforces: 80% on all metrics
   - Scope: Limited to critical tests only

2. **`packages/atomvm/vitest.config.mjs`** (39/38/36/39) ❌
   - Lines: 39% (BELOW 80%)
   - Functions: 38% (BELOW 80%)
   - Branches: 36% (BELOW 80%)
   - Statements: 39% (BELOW 80%)
   - Status: **BELOW STANDARD** - needs 41pp increase

## File Organization Analysis

### Test File Patterns

| Pattern       | Count | Status      | Action Required              |
|---------------|-------|-------------|------------------------------|
| `*.test.mjs`  | 109   | ✅ Standard | None                         |
| `*.spec.mjs`  | 2     | ⚠️ Outlier  | Rename to `*.test.mjs`       |

**Outliers**: Find and rename with:
```bash
find packages -name "*.spec.mjs"
# Expected: 2 files
# Action: Rename to *.test.mjs
```

### Test Distribution (Top 5 Packages)

```
atomvm:          26 tests (Browser/jsdom environment)
kgc-4d:          24 tests (Knowledge graph 4D)
hooks:           20 tests (36% failing ❌)
core:             9 tests (RDF operations, 60s timeout)
federation:       6 tests (122 test cases, 100% passing ✅)
```

---

## Configuration Standardization Status

### Test Scripts (Consistent ✅)

All packages follow standard pattern:

```json
{
  "test": "vitest run --coverage",
  "test:fast": "vitest run --coverage",
  "test:watch": "vitest --coverage"
}
```

**Outliers**:
- `core`: Uses `--no-coverage` for performance tests
- `hooks`: Adds browser test variants (Playwright)

### Coverage Reporters (Consistent ✅)

All packages use:
```javascript
coverage: {
  provider: 'v8',
  reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html']
}
```

**Missing**: LCOV reporter for CI integration (should add)

### Timeout Configuration (Inconsistent ⚠️)

| Package      | testTimeout | hookTimeout | Justified? |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| core         | 60s         | Default     | ✅ RDF ops |
| atomvm       | 10s         | 5s          | ✅ Browser |
| **Others**   | **MISSING** | **MISSING** | ❌ No      |

**Action**: Add explicit timeouts to all configs (default: 15s/5s)

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Federation Package Analysis

**Test Execution**: ✅ All 122 tests passing
**Coverage**: ❌ latest% overall (BELOW 80%)

**Coverage Breakdown**:
```
✅ health.mjs: 100% (perfect)
✅ metrics.mjs: latest% (excellent)
✅ peer-manager.mjs: latest% (good)
✅ coordinator.mjs: 84% (good)
✅ distributed-query.mjs: latest% (barely passing)
❌ federation-coordinator.mjs: latest% (FAIL)
❌ consensus-manager.mjs: latest% (CRITICAL)
```

**Root Cause**: No thresholds → `consensus-manager.mjs` at 19% doesn't block merge

**Recommendation**:
1. Add 80% thresholds to `vitest.config.mjs`
2. Add tests for consensus-manager.mjs (need +61pp coverage)
3. Add tests for federation-coordinator.mjs (need +21pp coverage)

### 2. Hooks Package Analysis

**Test Execution**: ❌ 32/87 tests failing (36% failure rate)
**Coverage**: Unknown (test run aborted)

**Failure Categories**:
1. Telemetry tests (4 failures):
   - Transaction span creation
   - Large attribute batches
   - Cleanup/teardown
   - Concurrent operations

2. File resolver tests (28 failures):
   - Path resolution (relative, nested, absolute)
   - URI handling (http/https schemes)
   - Path normalization (.. and . handling)
   - SHA-256 validation

**Root Cause**: Test infrastructure issues or actual bugs?

**Recommendation**:
1. Investigate test failures (likely OTEL/filesystem mocking issues)
2. Fix root causes
3. Add 80% thresholds after tests pass
4. Verify with OTEL validation (per CLAUDE.md)

### 3. Atomvm Package Analysis

**Configuration**: Thresholds set to 39/38/36/39 (BELOW 80%)

**Status**: Only package with thresholds, but **NOT PRODUCTION STANDARD**

**Gap Analysis**:
```
Current: 39% lines    → Target: 80%    = +41pp needed
Current: 38% functions → Target: 80%   = +42pp needed
Current: 36% branches  → Target: 80%   = +44pp needed
Current: 39% statements → Target: 80%  = +41pp needed
```

**Recommendation**:
1. Add 330+ lines of test code (estimated)
2. Focus on uncovered branches (largest gap: 44pp)
3. Use `vitest --coverage --reporter=html` to identify gaps
4. Target service worker, COI features (likely uncovered)

## Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1 (Week 1): Add Coverage Thresholds

**Affected**: 18 packages
**Template**:
```javascript
coverage: {
  thresholds: {
    lines: 80,
    functions: 80,
    branches: 80,
    statements: 80,
  }
}
```

**Batch Execution**:
```bash
# Day 1: Critical packages
packages/core/vitest.config.mjs
packages/hooks/vitest.config.mjs        # After fixing test failures
packages/federation/vitest.config.mjs
packages/streaming/vitest.config.mjs

# Day 2: Supporting packages
packages/cli/vitest.config.mjs
packages/composables/vitest.config.mjs
packages/oxigraph/vitest.config.mjs
packages/validation/vitest.config.mjs

# Day 3: Remaining packages
# ... (10 more packages)
```

### Priority 2 (Week 1): Fix Test Failures

**Package**: hooks
**Tests**: 32 failures (telemetry + file-resolver)

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Run with verbose output
pnpm -C packages/hooks test:watch

# Check for:
# - Missing OTEL provider setup
# - Filesystem mock configuration
# - Timing/async issues
# - Environment variable requirements
```

### Priority 3 (Week 2): Increase Coverage

**Targets**:
1. **Federation**: consensus-manager.mjs (19% → 80%)
2. **Atomvm**: All files (39% → 80%)

**Strategy**:
```bash
# Generate coverage report
pnpm -C packages/federation test

# Open HTML report
open packages/federation/coverage/index.html

# Identify uncovered lines
# Write tests for red-highlighted sections
# Re-run until ≥80%
```

### Priority 4 (Week 2): Standardize Configuration

**Actions**:
1. Rename `*.spec.mjs` → `*.test.mjs` (2 files)
2. Add explicit timeouts to all configs
3. Add LCOV reporter for CI
4. Add CI vs local reporter split
