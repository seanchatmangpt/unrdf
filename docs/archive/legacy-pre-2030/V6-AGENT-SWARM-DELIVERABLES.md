## ⚠️ Critical Findings (Adversarial PM)

### Blockers for vlatest Release
1. **605 Determinism Violations** - Replace Date.now() with @unrdf/kgc-4d abstraction (2-4 hours)
2. **Missing Dependencies** - Run `pnpm install` in packages/yawl (5 minutes)
3. **Zod Coverage** - Only 24% adoption, need 100% (175 days effort)
4. **Federation API** - v6 requirements not implemented (14 days)
5. **Large Files** - 19 files >500 lines, need refactoring (38 days)

### P0 Effort: latest days (parallelizable to 42 days with 5 devs)
