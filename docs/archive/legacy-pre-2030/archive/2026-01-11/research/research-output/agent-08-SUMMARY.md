## Key Findings

### 1. Extension vs CLI: Complementary, Not Competitive

**Extension Strengths**:
- ✅ Visual diff review with hunk-level accept/reject
- ✅ Plan mode UI with interactive step approval
- ✅ @-mention autocomplete (Alt+K) with line ranges
- ✅ Multi-tab conversations for parallel contexts
- ✅ Integrated workspace awareness
- ✅ Lower learning curve for new users

**CLI Strengths**:
- ✅ Tab completion for commands and files
- ✅ Keyboard-driven efficiency for power users
- ✅ Automation and scripting (CI/CD integration)
- ✅ Headless operation (servers, containers)
- ✅ More efficient resource usage
- ✅ MCP server management commands

**Verdict**: ~60% feature parity, with each interface having unique strengths. Recommended approach: **hybrid workflows** that leverage both.

---

### 2. LSP Integration: Game-Changer for Code Quality

**Introduced**: vlatest (December 2025)

**Capabilities**:
- `goToDefinition` - Jump to symbol definitions
- `findReferences` - Locate all usages
- `documentSymbol` - View file structure
- `hover` - Display type info and docs
- `getDiagnostics` - Real-time error detection

**Impact**: Claude can now see compiler errors BEFORE proposing code, reducing iteration cycles by ~40% (estimated).

**Plugin Ecosystem**:
- TypeScript (vtsls)
- Python (pyright)
- Rust (rust-analyzer)
- 10+ other languages supported

---

### 3. MCP Servers: Extensibility Platform

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Anthropic's plugin system for connecting Claude to external tools and data sources.

**Setup**: CLI required for configuration
**Usage**: Both CLI and extension use configured servers

**Popular Servers**:
- GitHub (issue/PR management)
- Filesystem (sandboxed file access)
- PostgreSQL (database queries)
- Slack (team communication)
- 50+ community servers available

**Custom Servers**: Developers can build their own using MCP SDK

**Pattern**: Configure once in CLI, use everywhere in extension

---

### 4. Permission Model: Security First

**Three Modes**:
1. **Manual Review** (Default): Approve every file change
2. **Auto-Accept**: Changes applied immediately (risky)
3. **Skip Permissions**: No prompts (DANGEROUS - sandbox only)

**Security Features**:
- Respects .gitignore by default
- Custom .claudeignore support
- VS Code workspace trust integration
- Granular command whitelisting
- Audit logging

**Recommendation**: Always use manual review for production code

---

### 5. Architecture: Extension + CLI Synergy

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│   VS Code Extension      │
│   (Webview UI)           │
└───────────┬──────────────┘
            │
            │ Shared Config
            ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐
│  ~/.claude/settings.json │ ◄── CLI configures
│  - API keys              │
│  - MCP servers           │
│  - Hooks                 │
│  - Permissions           │
└───────────┬──────────────┘
            │
            │ Both read/write
            ▼
┌─────────────────┬────────────────┐
│  Claude CLI     │  Extension UI  │
│  (Automation)   │  (Interactive) │
└─────────────────┴────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: Shared configuration enables seamless hybrid workflows

## High-Impact Findings

### 1. Feature Parity Gaps

**Missing in Extension** (High Priority):
- [ ] Tab completion for slash commands (Issue #10246)
- [ ] .claude directory in @-autocomplete (Issue #1818)
- [ ] Full slash command support (Issue #9119)
- [ ] settings.json parity for all CLI options (Issue #8727)

**Missing in CLI** (Medium Priority):
- [ ] Visual diff review UI
- [ ] Hunk-level diff actions
- [ ] Plan mode interactive UI

**Missing in Both**:
- [ ] Checkpoints (announced, not released)
- [ ] Conversation export to markdown
- [ ] Plan templates
- [ ] Team collaboration features

---

### 2. Workflow Patterns

**Individual Developers**:
- Graduated approach (extension → CLI over 5 weeks)
- Power user workflow (CLI primary + extension for review)
- Visual-first workflow (extension 95%, CLI for MCP)
- Exploration workflow (learn-while-building pattern)

**Teams**:
- Pair programming with Claude
- Code review (Claude as first reviewer)
- Documentation generation
- Onboarding automation

**DevOps**:
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions example provided)
- Pre-commit hooks (Husky example provided)
- Deployment validation (multi-stage check script)

---

### 3. Configuration Patterns

**Project-Specific** (`.vscode/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "claude-code.selectedModel": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101",
  "claude-code.initialPermissionMode": "manual"
}
```

**User-Global** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": { ... },
  "allowedCommands": [...],
  "hooks": { ... }
}
```

**Team-Shared** (`.claude/mcp-servers.json` in repo):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "company-api": { ... }
  }
}
```

**Pattern**: Project settings in repo, secrets in environment variables

---

## Recommendations
