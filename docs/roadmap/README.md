## 📋 GOAP Methodology Overview

### What is GOAP?

**Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)** is an AI planning algorithm that:
1. Defines **current state** (what is true now)
2. Defines **goal state** (what should be true)
3. Generates **action sequences** to transform current → goal
4. Uses **preconditions** to ensure actions are valid
5. Tracks **effects** to measure state changes
6. Calculates **optimal paths** using A* search
7. Supports **dynamic replanning** based on execution

### Why GOAP for Roadmap Planning?

**Traditional Roadmaps:**
- Linear, inflexible timelines
- No clear state transitions
- Unclear dependencies
- Difficult to replan when things change

**GOAP-Based Roadmaps:**
- ✅ Clear state models (current → goal)
- ✅ Explicit preconditions and effects
- ✅ Dependency-aware planning
- ✅ Optimal action sequences (A* search)
- ✅ Support for replanning when risks occur
- ✅ Parallel execution opportunities identified
- ✅ Cost-based optimization

### GOAP in Practice (Example)

**Goal:** Enable semantic search

**Current State:**
```javascript
{
  rdf_store: true,
  vector_db: false,
  embeddings: false,
  semantic_search: false
}
```

**Goal State:**
```javascript
{
  semantic_search: true
}
```

**GOAP Generates Action Sequence:**
```
1. integrate_vector_db
   Preconditions: { rdf_store: true }
   Effects: { vector_db: true }
   Cost: 5

2. generate_embeddings
   Preconditions: { vector_db: true, rdf_store: true }
   Effects: { embeddings: true }
   Cost: 3

3. build_vector_search
   Preconditions: { embeddings: true, vector_db: true }
   Effects: { semantic_search: true }
   Cost: 4

Total Cost: 12
Total Duration: 5 weeks (2 + 1 + 2)
```

**Replanning Example:**
If `integrate_vector_db` fails or takes too long, GOAP can find alternative path:
- Use open-source vector DB (Qdrant) instead of Pinecone
- Adjust costs and durations
- Regenerate optimal plan
