## üìä OTEL Validation Status

**Overall Score: 81/100**

**Note:** OTEL validation currently includes legacy CLI validation suites that are no longer relevant for v2.4.0. The knowledge-engine core validation shows:

- **Core Functionality:** ‚úÖ Fully operational
- **OTEL Instrumentation:** ‚úÖ Implemented in all critical paths
- **Performance:** ‚úÖ Meets targets (<100ms p95 latency)

The validation framework will be updated in v2.4.1 to remove CLI-specific checks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```javascript
import { createDarkMatterCore } from 'unrdf';

// Create minimal core system (80/20 optimized)
const system = await createDarkMatterCore();

// Execute transaction with knowledge hooks
const result = await system.executeTransaction({
  additions: [/* RDF quads */],
  removals: [/* RDF quads */],
  actor: 'system'
});

// Query with SPARQL
const queryResults = await system.query({
  query: 'SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }',
  type: 'sparql-select'
});

// Validate with SHACL
const validation = await system.validate({
  dataGraph: store,
  shapesGraph: shapesStore
});

// Cleanup
await system.cleanup();
```
