title Git + Knowledge Hooks Integration - Actual Flow (Current Issue)

participant "Test" as Test
participant "RdfEngine" as Engine
participant "EventBus" as EventBus
participant "ObservableStore" as Store
participant "useKnowledgeHooks" as KnowledgeHooks
participant "registerHook" as GitHooks

== Setup Phase ==
Test -> KnowledgeHooks: useKnowledgeHooks()
KnowledgeHooks -> Engine: get engine instance
Test -> KnowledgeHooks: registerKnowledgeHook(hook)
KnowledgeHooks -> EventBus: engine.on('afterAddQuad', handler)
EventBus -> EventBus: register handler with hook.id
Note over EventBus: Knowledge hook registered ✅

Test -> GitHooks: registerHook(engine, config)
GitHooks -> EventBus: engine.on('afterAddQuad', handler)
EventBus -> EventBus: register handler with config.id
Note over EventBus: Git hook registered ✅

== Execution Phase ==
Test -> Store: addQuad(subject, predicate, object)
Store -> EventBus: emit('beforeAddQuad', payload)
EventBus -> GitHooks: call beforeAddQuad handler
GitHooks -> GitHooks: evaluate predicates
GitHooks -> EventBus: return true/false (veto)

alt Operation NOT vetoed
    Store -> Store: actually add quad to N3.Store
    Store -> EventBus: emit('afterAddQuad', payload)
    EventBus -> GitHooks: call afterAddQuad handler
    GitHooks -> GitHooks: evaluate predicates
    GitHooks -> Test: push to lifecycleEvents array
    Note over EventBus: Git hook called ✅
    
    EventBus -> KnowledgeHooks: call afterAddQuad handler
    Note over EventBus: Knowledge hook NOT called ❌
    Note over KnowledgeHooks: Handler never executed
    Note over Test: knowledgeEvents array remains empty
else Operation vetoed
    Store -> Store: skip adding quad
    Note over EventBus: No afterAddQuad event emitted
end
