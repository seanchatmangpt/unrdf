## Executive Summary

Transform the UNRDF CLI from a 1312-line monolithic verb-only implementation to an enterprise-grade noun-verb pattern (like kubectl, aws, docker) with KGC sidecar integration, achieving Six Sigma quality standards (3.4 DPMO).

## Business Case

### Problem Statement

The current UNRDF CLI (v1.0) suffers from:
- **Monolithic Architecture**: 1312 lines, difficult to maintain and extend
- **Verb-Only Commands**: Non-standard pattern, poor developer experience
- **Limited Scalability**: No KGC sidecar integration for policy enforcement
- **Inconsistent Performance**: No defined performance targets or SLAs
- **Low Test Coverage**: Insufficient quality gates

**Business Impact**:
- Reduced developer productivity (estimated 30% time waste on CLI learning curve)
- High technical debt ($50K+ estimated remediation cost if delayed)
- Enterprise adoption blockers (no policy enforcement)
- Competitive disadvantage vs. kubectl-style CLIs

### Opportunity Statement

By transforming to an enterprise noun-verb CLI with KGC sidecar integration, we will:
- **Increase Developer Productivity**: 50% reduction in CLI learning curve
- **Enable Enterprise Adoption**: Policy pack governance and audit trails
- **Achieve Six Sigma Quality**: 3.4 defects per million opportunities
- **Meet Performance SLAs**: p99 < 100ms for all CLI operations
- **Reduce Maintenance Costs**: 70% reduction via modular architecture

**Financial Impact**:
- **Revenue Opportunity**: $500K+ in enterprise licensing potential
- **Cost Savings**: $75K/year in reduced support and maintenance
- **Time-to-Market**: 60% faster feature delivery with modular design
- **ROI**: 320% over 18 months

### Strategic Alignment

This project aligns with:
- **Product Strategy**: Enterprise knowledge graph platform
- **Technical Strategy**: Composable, policy-driven architecture
- **Quality Strategy**: Six Sigma standards for all components
- **Innovation Strategy**: Leading-edge CLI patterns with Knowledge Hooks

## Project Scope

   - Integrate unctx for context management

2. **KGC Sidecar Integration**
   - Policy pack enforcement via Knowledge Hooks
   - Cryptographic audit trails (lockchain)
   - Sandboxed effect execution
   - Multi-agent coordination

3. **Quality & Performance**
   - Achieve 95%+ test coverage on critical paths
   - Meet p99 < 100ms performance targets

   - Create comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, e2e, performance)

4. **Documentation & Training**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Developer migration guide
   - CLI usage examples
   - Quality metrics dashboard

### Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of core RDF functionality (use existing composables)

- Advanced CLI features beyond 80% value commands
- Non-Node.js CLI implementations

### Boundaries

- **Technical**: Node.js 18+, ESM modules, existing UNRDF v2.0 codebase
- **Timeline**: 6-week delivery window (Q1 2025)
- **Resources**: Hive mind agents + existing development team
- **Budget**: Internal project, no external costs
