## 12. Limitations and Future Work

### 8.1 Current Limitations

#### 8.1.1 Canonicalization Performance

URDNA2015 has O(n log n) complexity for n-triple stores, limiting scalability to ~1M triples with acceptable latency.

**Mitigation**: Fast path mode (afterHashOnly) provides O(n) hashing for 80% of use cases.

**Future Work**:
- Incremental canonicalization algorithms
- Hardware acceleration using SIMD instructions
- Distributed canonicalization for multi-million triple stores

#### 8.1.2 Predicate Expressiveness

Current predicate types cover common use cases but lack:
- Recursive graph patterns
- Temporal reasoning beyond simple windows
- Probabilistic predicates

**Future Work**:
- Custom predicate extensions via plugin system
- Integration with reasoning engines (EYE, Jena)
- Probabilistic knowledge graphs with uncertainty quantification

#### 8.1.3 Multi-Agent Coordination

Current resolution strategies are synchronous and require all agents to respond.

**Future Work**:
- Asynchronous coordination with eventual consistency
- Byzantine fault tolerance for malicious agents
- Consensus protocols (Raft, Paxos) for distributed deployment

### 8.2 Ongoing Research

#### 8.2.1 Quantum-Resistant Cryptography

Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for long-term audit trail security.

**Candidates**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (signatures), SPHINCS+ (stateless hash-based signatures)

#### 8.2.2 Federated Knowledge Hooks

Hooks that span multiple federated knowledge graphs.

**Challenges**:
- Cross-domain canonicalization
- Distributed provenance tracking
- Privacy-preserving hook evaluation

#### 8.2.3 Machine Learning Integration

- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based predicates for outlier detection
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Learn optimal thresholds from historical data
- **Predictive Hooks**: Trigger on predicted future states

### 8.3 Standardization Efforts

#### 8.3.1 W3C Community Group

Proposing Knowledge Hooks as a W3C standard for RDF reactivity.

**Draft Specification**: https://w3c.github.io/knowledge-hooks/

#### 8.3.2 Interoperability

**Target**: Compatibility with:
- Apache Jena
- RDF4J
- Oxigraph
- Comunica

**Challenge**: Different canonicalization implementations and hash algorithms.
