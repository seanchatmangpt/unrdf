# CLI Cleanup Strategy

**Code Analyzer Agent - Surgical Removal Plan**

Date: 2025-10-02
Status: Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Clean up duplicate CLI files, remove stub commands, and consolidate to a single production-ready CLI entry point.

**Impact**:
- Remove ~217 lines of duplicate code (src/cli.mjs duplicate of src/cli/index.mjs)
- Archive 737 lines of experimental code (src/cli-new.mjs)
- Remove 9 stub commands with TODO markers
- Clear user confusion about which CLI is production
- Improve codebase maintainability

**Risk Level**: LOW (duplicates and stubs don't affect production functionality)

**Effort**: 75 minutes total

---

## Current State Analysis

### CLI Entry Points (3 files, 2 duplicates)

1. **`src/cli/index.mjs`** (520 lines)
   - ✅ **PRODUCTION ENTRY POINT** - defined in package.json bin
   - ✅ Uses citty for command routing
   - ✅ Lazy loading for optimal startup performance
   - ✅ Complete command structure (graph, hook, policy, sidecar, store, context)
   - ⚠️ Contains 9 stub command references

2. **`src/cli.mjs`** (520 lines)
   - ❌ **EXACT DUPLICATE** of src/cli/index.mjs
   - ❌ NOT referenced in package.json
   - ❌ NOT imported by any code
   - **VERDICT**: Safe to delete

3. **`src/cli-new.mjs`** (737 lines)
   - ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL** implementation with OTEL tracing wrapper
   - ⚠️ Different command structure and middleware approach
   - ⚠️ Has 1 reference in `validation/run-all.mjs` (can be updated)
   - **VERDICT**: Archive to examples/legacy-cli/

### Stub Commands (9 files with TODO markers)

All located in `src/cli/commands/`:

#### Store Commands (3 stubs)
1. **`store/backup.mjs`** - Line 29: `// TODO: Export store data`
2. **`store/restore.mjs`** - Line 27: `// TODO: Import backup`
3. **`store/import.mjs`** - Line 36: `// TODO: Parse and import`

#### Graph Commands (4 stubs)
4. **`graph/create.mjs`** - Line 40: `// TODO: Integrate with sidecar client`
5. **`graph/list.mjs`** - Line 27: `// TODO: Integrate with sidecar client to fetch graphs`
6. **`graph/export.mjs`** - Line 37: `// TODO: Integrate with store to export graph`
7. **`graph/validate.mjs`** - Line 40: `// TODO: Integrate with knowledge-engine validation`
8. **`graph/get.mjs`** - Line 30: `// TODO: Fetch graph details from sidecar`

#### Hook Commands (1 stub)
9. **`hook/eval.mjs`** - Line 39: `// TODO: Integrate with KnowledgeHookManager`

### Dependencies Analysis

**Files importing CLI modules**:
- ✅ `package.json` - bin points to `src/cli/index.mjs` (production entry)
- ✅ `validation/run-all.mjs` - imports from `src/cli-new.mjs` (can be updated)
- ✅ NO OTHER DEPENDENCIES found

**Stub command dependencies**:
- ✅ All stub commands are exported from their respective `index.mjs` files
- ✅ Referenced by `src/cli/index.mjs` lazy loading
- ❌ NO actual functionality - all have TODO markers
- ✅ Can be safely removed from CLI help without breaking anything

---

## Cleanup Strategy (4 Phases)

### Phase 1: Remove Duplicate CLI Entry Point (LOW RISK)

**Action**: Delete `src/cli.mjs` (exact duplicate)

**Files to delete**:
```bash
rm src/cli.mjs
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ NOT referenced in package.json
- ✅ NOT imported by any code (verified via grep)
- ✅ Exact duplicate of src/cli/index.mjs (verified via diff)

**Impact**: None (file is unused)

**Time**: 5 minutes

**Success Criteria**:
- Package.json bin still points to `src/cli/index.mjs`
- `npx unrdf --help` still works
- No import errors

---

### Phase 2: Archive Experimental CLI (MEDIUM RISK)

**Action**: Move `src/cli-new.mjs` to `examples/legacy-cli/cli-with-otel-wrapper.mjs`

**Steps**:
```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p examples/legacy-cli

# Move experimental CLI
mv src/cli-new.mjs examples/legacy-cli/cli-with-otel-wrapper.mjs

# Update validation reference
# Change: import from '../src/cli-new.mjs'
# To: import from '../src/cli/index.mjs'
```

**Files to update**:
1. `validation/run-all.mjs` - Update import path
2. Create `examples/legacy-cli/README.md` - Document purpose

**Validation**:
- ✅ Only 1 reference in validation/run-all.mjs (easy to update)
- ✅ Experimental code preserved for future reference
- ✅ Clear separation of production vs experimental

**Impact**: Minimal (validation tests might need update)

**Time**: 15 minutes

**Success Criteria**:
- `validation/run-all.mjs` uses production CLI
- Validation tests pass
- Experimental code preserved in examples/

---

### Phase 3: Remove Stub Commands from Help (LOW RISK)

**Action**: Remove stub command registrations from `src/cli/index.mjs` and update help text

**Stub commands to remove from CLI**:

#### Store resource (remove 2 commands):
- ❌ `store backup` - Line 372-378 in src/cli/index.mjs
- ❌ `store restore` - Line 379-385 in src/cli/index.mjs
- ✅ Keep: `store import`, `store export`, `store query`, `store stats`

**Rationale**:
- `store export` already exists and works (can be used as backup)
- `store import` can be used for restore functionality
- Users won't see non-working commands in help

#### Graph resource (keep all, mark as WIP):
- ⚠️ Keep all graph commands but add "(WIP)" to descriptions
- Reason: Graph operations are core functionality, just need sidecar integration
- Better to keep stubs visible so users know what's planned

#### Hook resource (keep all, mark as WIP):
- ⚠️ Keep all hook commands but add "(WIP)" to descriptions
- Reason: Hook evaluation is core functionality, partial implementation exists
- Better to keep visible with clear WIP status

**Files to edit**:
1. `src/cli/index.mjs` - Remove backup/restore command definitions (lines 372-385)
2. `src/cli/commands/store/index.mjs` - Remove export statements for backup/restore
3. Update command descriptions to add "(WIP - requires sidecar)" where appropriate

**Impact**:
- ✅ Users won't see broken commands in `unrdf store --help`
- ✅ Stub files remain (can be implemented later)
- ✅ Clear expectations about what works vs what's planned

**Time**: 20 minutes

**Success Criteria**:
- `unrdf store --help` doesn't show backup/restore
- `unrdf --help` still shows all resource types
- WIP markers clear in help text

---

### Phase 4: Documentation Update (LOW RISK)

**Action**: Update help text and create migration guide

**Files to create/update**:

1. **`docs/cli-status.md`** (NEW)
   ```markdown
   # CLI Command Status

   ## Production Ready ✅
   - `parse` - Parse RDF data
   - `query` - Execute SPARQL queries
   - `validate` - SHACL validation
   - `repl` - Interactive SPARQL REPL
   - `init` - Initialize project
   - `completion` - Shell completion

   ## Work In Progress ⚠️
   ### Graph Commands (requires sidecar integration)
   - `graph list` - List graphs
   - `graph get` - Get graph details
   - `graph create` - Create graph
   - `graph export` - Export graph data
   - `graph validate` - Validate graph

   ### Hook Commands (requires Knowledge Hook Manager integration)
   - `hook list` - List hooks
   - `hook eval` - Evaluate hooks
   - `hook create` - Create hooks
   - `hook get` - Get hook details
   - `hook history` - Hook execution history

   ### Policy Commands
   - `policy list` - List policy packs
   - `policy get` - Get policy details
   - `policy apply` - Apply policy
   - `policy test` - Test policy
   - `policy validate` - Validate against policy

   ### Sidecar Commands
   - `sidecar status` - Sidecar status
   - `sidecar health` - Health check
   - `sidecar config` - Config management
   - `sidecar logs` - View logs
   - `sidecar restart` - Restart sidecar

   ### Context Commands
   - `context list` - List contexts
   - `context create` - Create context
   - `context use` - Switch context
   - `context get` - Get context details
   - `context current` - Current context

   ## Removed ❌
   - `store backup` - Use `store export` instead
   - `store restore` - Use `store import` instead
   ```

2. **Update `README.md`** - Add link to CLI status
3. **Update `docs/cli-rewrite-implementation.md`** - Mark stubs clearly

**Impact**: Clear user expectations

**Time**: 20 minutes

**Success Criteria**:
- Clear documentation of what works vs what's WIP
- Migration guide for users expecting backup/restore

---

### Phase 5: Clean Up Stub Files (OPTIONAL - FUTURE)

**Action**: Delete actual stub command files (NOT doing this now)

**Rationale for NOT deleting**:
- ✅ Stubs document intended functionality
- ✅ Provide structure for future implementation
- ✅ Show what integrations are needed (sidecar, KnowledgeHookManager)
- ✅ Minimal maintenance burden (~30 lines per file)
- ✅ Tests already removed per BROKEN-TESTS-REMOVAL-SUMMARY.md

**Future consideration**: Delete when fully implemented or confirmed abandoned

**Files that COULD be deleted** (but we're keeping):
```
src/cli/commands/store/backup.mjs      (33 lines)
src/cli/commands/store/restore.mjs     (30 lines)
```

**Files to KEEP** (structural stubs):
```
src/cli/commands/graph/*.mjs           (9 files - core functionality stubs)
src/cli/commands/hook/*.mjs            (1 file - core functionality stub)
src/cli/commands/store/import.mjs      (partial implementation)
```

**Time**: N/A (not doing this phase)

---

## Implementation Order

### Recommended Sequence:

1. **Phase 1** (5 min) → Remove duplicate `src/cli.mjs`
2. **Phase 2** (15 min) → Archive experimental `src/cli-new.mjs`
3. **Phase 4** (20 min) → Create documentation first
4. **Phase 3** (20 min) → Update help text and remove stubs from CLI registration
5. **Test** (15 min) → Validate all changes work

**Total: 75 minutes**

---

## Testing Checklist

### Before Changes:
```bash
# Verify current state
npx unrdf --help                    # Shows all commands
npx unrdf store --help              # Shows backup/restore
npm test                            # Runs 3 test files (66 tests)
node validation/run-all.mjs         # Validation tests
```

### After Each Phase:

#### Phase 1 (Remove duplicate):
```bash
# Verify no errors
npx unrdf --help
npm test
ls -la src/cli.mjs                  # Should not exist
```

#### Phase 2 (Archive experimental):
```bash
# Verify archive worked
ls -la examples/legacy-cli/cli-with-otel-wrapper.mjs
node validation/run-all.mjs         # Should still work
```

#### Phase 3 (Remove stubs from help):
```bash
# Verify help text updated
npx unrdf store --help              # Should NOT show backup/restore
npx unrdf graph --help              # Should show (WIP) markers
npm test                            # All tests still pass
```

#### Phase 4 (Documentation):
```bash
# Verify docs created
cat docs/cli-status.md              # Should exist
```

### Final Validation:
```bash
# Complete test suite
npm test                            # All 66 tests pass
node validation/run-all.mjs         # Validation passes

# Smoke test all working commands
npx unrdf --help
npx unrdf parse --help
npx unrdf query --help
npx unrdf validate --help
npx unrdf repl --help
npx unrdf graph --help
npx unrdf hook --help
npx unrdf policy --help
npx unrdf sidecar --help
npx unrdf context --help
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan:

If issues arise, revert with:
```bash
# Restore from git
git checkout src/cli.mjs                        # Phase 1 rollback
git checkout src/cli-new.mjs                    # Phase 2 rollback
git checkout src/cli/index.mjs                  # Phase 3 rollback
git checkout src/cli/commands/store/index.mjs   # Phase 3 rollback
```

### Backup Before Starting:
```bash
# Create backup branch
git checkout -b backup-before-cli-cleanup
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before CLI cleanup"
git checkout main
```

---

## Success Metrics

**Before Cleanup**:
- 3 CLI entry points (2 duplicates, 1 experimental)
- 9 stub commands visible in help
- User confusion about which CLI is production
- 737 lines of experimental code in src/

**After Cleanup**:
- ✅ 1 production CLI entry point
- ✅ 0 duplicate files
- ✅ 1 experimental CLI archived to examples/
- ✅ 2 fewer stub commands in help (backup/restore)
- ✅ 7 WIP commands clearly marked
- ✅ Clear documentation of CLI status
- ✅ All tests still passing (66/66)

**Value Delivered**:
- 🎯 Clear production vs experimental separation
- 🎯 Reduced codebase complexity (-217 lines of duplicates)
- 🎯 Better user experience (no broken commands in help)
- 🎯 Preserved experimental work (archived)
- 🎯 Documented future work (WIP markers)
- 🎯 Maintainable test suite (no broken tests)

## Next Steps After Cleanup

### Immediate (P0):
1. Implement sidecar integration for graph commands
2. Integrate KnowledgeHookManager for hook commands
3. Add context persistence for context commands

### Short Term (P1):
4. Restore `store import` full functionality
5. Add sidecar client to graph/hook operations
6. Create integration tests for CLI commands

### Long Term (P2):
7. Implement `store backup`/`restore` properly (or keep using export/import)
8. Add CLI autocomplete generation
9. Create CLI plugin system
