## Abstract

We introduce a **field-theoretic computational paradigm** that departs from traditional discrete-state models, proposing a continuous, vector-based framework for autonomic intelligent systems. We formalize **Knowledge Hooks**—global information vectors whose geometric interactions define system state and drive behavior—grounded in Information Field Theory and hyperdimensional computing principles. We present **Knowledge Geometry Calculus (KGC)**, the first autonomic RDF framework that transforms static knowledge graphs into self-configuring, self-healing, self-optimizing systems through declarative governance, cryptographic provenance, and multi-agent coordination.

Unlike traditional approaches requiring external event systems or combinatorial state-space search, KGC provides a unified vector-based calculus achieving O(kd) computational complexity (k hooks, d dimensions) versus O(b^d) tree search complexity. Our reference implementation achieves p50 ≤ 200µs and p99 ≤ 2ms latency on 10k triple stores with sustained ≥10k hook executions per minute, validated in ultra-high-frequency trading (UHFT) scenarios demanding microsecond determinism.

We demonstrate this framework's capacity to **mechanize complex knowledge work** through KGEN (Autonomic IPO Generator), eliminating 95-98% of manual artifact production in compliance, financial reporting, and code generation domains. We position KGC as a **Blue Ocean innovation** that redefines enterprise software economics by eliminating the "dark matter" (80%) of bespoke integration and manual governance, creating an uncontested market for autonomic knowledge management where code becomes a disposable build artifact rather than the primary asset.
