# CONTROL Phase: Monitoring & Governance Strategy

## Overview

This document establishes ongoing monitoring, quality gates, and governance for sustaining v5.0.0 improvements long-term and preventing regression to v4 levels of bloat.

---

## Control Phase Objectives

1. **Prevent Feature Creep**: Stop new bloat before it starts
2. **Monitor Quality**: Track all key metrics continuously
3. **Maintain Boundaries**: Keep packages separated
4. **Ensure Adoption**: Guide users to correct packages
5. **Drive Improvement**: Continuous 80/20 optimization

---

## 1. Metrics Monitoring Framework

### Metric Collection Methods

**Automated Collection** (CI/CD):
```bash
# Weekly automation
npm test --coverage      # Test coverage
npm run build            # Bundle size
time npm run test:fast   # Execution time
npm audit                # Security check
eslint src/             # Lint count
```

**Manual Review** (Weekly):
```bash
# Check key metrics
git log --oneline | head -20    # Commit velocity
npm view unrdf downloads        # Monthly downloads
wc -l src/**/*.mjs              # Total LOC
grep -r "export " src/index.mjs # Function count
```

**User Feedback** (Continuous):
```
GitHub Issues: Monitor for:
  ├─ "Is this the right way?" → Documentation gap
  ├─ "Why doesn't this work?" → API clarity issue
  ├─ Feature requests → Validate against scope
  └─ Bug reports → Priority based on impact

npm Discussions: Track satisfaction
```

---

## 2. Quality Gates (Hard Boundaries)

### Pre-Merge Gates (GitHub Branch Protection)

Every commit to main must pass:

```yaml
# Required Status Checks (GitHub Actions)
checks:
  - name: "test:fast (must pass)"
    timeout: 30s
    rule: "must pass all 737+ tests"

  - name: "lint (must pass)"
    timeout: 30s
    rule: "zero warnings, all rules enabled"

  - name: "format (must pass)"
    timeout: 30s
    rule: "all files properly formatted"

  - name: "type-check (must pass)"
    timeout: 30s
    rule: "100% type coverage"

  - name: "bundle-size (must pass)"
    rule: "bundle size must be <1.2 MB"

  - name: "test-coverage (must pass)"
    rule: "coverage must be ≥95%"

  - name: "security-audit (must pass)"
    rule: "npm audit must pass"
```

### Code Quality Rules

**Hard Stops** (Must not merge):
1. ❌ **Code Size**: Adding 100+ LOC without removing equivalent
2. ❌ **New Functions**: Adding functions without removing redundant ones
3. ❌ **Dependencies**: Adding dependencies without justification
4. ❌ **Untyped Code**: Any export without complete JSDoc type coverage
5. ❌ **Bundle Bloat**: Increasing bundle size >10% without optimization
6. ❌ **Test Regressions**: Any test failures (must fix before merge)
7. ❌ **Lint Violations**: Any new warnings (zero tolerance)

**Warnings** (Must have justification in commit):
1. ⚠️ **Performance**: Query time >15ms (document reason)
2. ⚠️ **Coverage Drop**: Below 95% (explain gaps)
3. ⚠️ **Complexity Spike**: Cyclomatic complexity >5
4. ⚠️ **Documentation Gap**: Feature not documented

### Feature Acceptance Criteria (for all PRs)

Before a PR can be merged:

```checklist
PRE-MERGE CHECKLIST

```

---

## 3. Regression Prevention

### Preventing Feature Bloat Recurrence

**Rule 1: One In, One Out**
- Adding a new function? Remove an old one.
- Adding a new file? Archive an old one.
- Adding a dependency? Remove an unused one.

**Rule 2: Scope Boundaries**
```javascript
// ✅ ALLOWED in unrdf core
import { useGraph } from 'unrdf'           // Composables
import { queryStore } from 'unrdf'         // Direct API
import { defineHook } from 'unrdf'         // Knowledge Hooks
import { validateShape } from 'unrdf'      // SHACL

// ❌ NOT ALLOWED in unrdf core
import { consensusVote } from 'unrdf'      // → unrdf-federation
import { optimizeQuery } from 'unrdf'      // → unrdf-advanced
import { subscribeToChanges } from 'unrdf' // → unrdf-streaming
import { createVaultPolicy } from 'unrdf'  // → unrdf-enterprise
```

**Rule 3: Quarterly Feature Audits**
- Every 3 months, review all exported functions
- Remove any that feel "bloaty"
- Move any that don't fit core mission
- Document the audit in release notes

### Package Boundary Enforcement

**Each Package Has Clear Boundaries**:

| Package | Purpose | Max LOC | Max Functions | Max Deps |
|---------|---------|---------|---------------|----------|
| unrdf (core) | Lightweight RDF | 35,000 | 70 | 20 |
| unrdf-federation | Distributed consensus | 10,000 | 30 | 15 |
| unrdf-streaming | Real-time updates | 5,000 | 25 | 5 |
| unrdf-advanced | Optimization rules | 8,000 | 20 | 10 |
| unrdf-enterprise | Policies & vault | 12,000 | 40 | 20 |
| unrdf-experimental | Research | 3,000 | 10 | 5 |

**Enforcement**:
```bash
# Pre-merge check: Size limits
npm run check-sizes  # Fails if any package exceeds limits

# Output:
# ✓ unrdf: 35,000 LOC (within 35,000 limit)
# ✓ unrdf-federation: 9,500 LOC (within 10,000 limit)
# ✗ unrdf-streaming: 5,200 LOC (EXCEEDS 5,000 limit)
# →  Review added code, move to unrdf-advanced if possible
```

```
Mon: Review GitHub issues (20+ closed daily?)
Tue: Check npm downloads (trending up?)
Wed: Verify bundle size (staying <1.2 MB?)
Thu: Audit new user feedback
Fri: Weekly metrics review & report
```

### Phase 2: Stabilization (Months 2-3)

**Frequency**: Weekly monitoring

**Key Focus**:
- User adoption curve (are people upgrading?)

- Package usage stats (are optional packages being used?)
- Performance in production (real-world metrics)

**Weekly Meetings**:
- Review metrics dashboard
- Discuss unexpected trends
- Prioritize bug fixes
- Plan next optimizations

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 4-6)

**Frequency**: Bi-weekly monitoring

**Key Focus**:
- Where are users struggling? (long onboarding times)
- Which guides are most viewed? (popular content)
- Which optional packages most downloaded? (adoption patterns)
- Performance bottlenecks? (80/20 analysis)

**Quarterly Actions**:
- Feature audit (remove any new bloat)
- Documentation refresh (update popular guides)
- Performance optimization (address bottlenecks)
- Dependency updates (security patches)

### Phase 4: Long-term Sustainability (Months 7+)

**Frequency**: Monthly monitoring

**Key Focus**:

## 5. Feedback Loops & Continuous Improvement

### User Feedback Channels

```
GitHub Issues (Reactive)
  ├─ Bugs: Fix immediately if critical
  ├─ Questions: Indicates documentation gap → improve docs
  ├─ Feature Requests: Evaluate against core mission
  │  ├─ Core feature? → Add if aligns with 80/20
  │  └─ Advanced? → Suggest as feature package
  └─ Enhancement: Low priority unless many requests

npm Discussions (Proactive)
  ├─ "Is this the right way?" → Documentation gap
  ├─ "How do I X?" → Missing guide
  ├─ "Why doesn't Y work?" → Usability issue
  └─ "Can you add Z?" → Feature inquiry

Stack Overflow (Signal Indicator)
  ├─ High question volume on tag → Pain point
  ├─ Repeated questions → Documentation needed
  └─ Advanced questions → Growing adoption (good!)

Social Media (Awareness)
  ├─ Mentions: Track sentiment
  ├─ Shares: Indicates value perception
  └─ Comparisons: Track positioning
```

### Improvement Feedback Loop

```
Observation → Root Cause → Solution → Test → Monitor → Optimize

Examples:

Observation: Users asking "how do I query RDF?"
Root Cause: Query guide not prominent enough
Solution: Move "Query SPARQL" to position 2 in guides
Test: Have new users follow guide, measure success
Monitor: Track "query" guide views, question volume
Optimize: If questions drop 50%, successful!

---

Observation: test:fast takes 20 seconds (target: 15)
Root Cause: Added 150 tests, slow ones in critical path
Solution: Optimize slow tests or move to separate suite
Test: Run tests, measure new execution time
Monitor: Track test execution trends
Optimize: Ensure stays <15s going forward

---

Observation: Bundle size increased to 1.05 MB
Root Cause: Added validation utilities
Solution: Move validation utils to separate module
Test: Rebuild, measure new bundle size
Monitor: Add CI check for <1 MB limit
Optimize: Prevent bloat recurrence
```

## 6. Version & Release Governance

### Semantic Versioning Rules (for v5.x and beyond)

```
v5.0.0 (Current)
├─ MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
│  ├─ MAJOR (5): Breaking changes only
│  ├─ MINOR (0): New features (additive only)
│  └─ PATCH (0): Bug fixes (no changes to API)
│
v5.1.0 (Next Quarter)
├─ MINOR bump for new feature package (e.g., unrdf-react-server)
├─ NO core API changes
├─ NO new exports added to core
└─ Still <35,000 LOC, 70 functions
│
v5.2.0 (Next Release Cycle)
├─ MINOR bump for optimization
├─ Performance improvements allowed
├─ Documentation updates
└─ Still maintains all v5.0 compatibility

v6.0.0 (Future, if needed)

## 8. Escalation & Exception Process

### When to Escalate (Decision Tree)

```
Is the metric outside expected range?
├─ YES → Is it a critical metric (tests, bundle, security)?
│  ├─ YES → CRITICAL: Fix immediately, escalate to leadership
│  │  └─ Examples: test failure, security vuln, bundle >1.2MB
│  └─ NO → NORMAL: Fix within sprint planning
│     └─ Examples: documentation clarity, performance, UX
└─ NO → Continue monitoring
```

### Exception Approval Process

**For Exceptions to Quality Gates** (e.g., "Allow bundle to be 1.1MB"):

```
Requestor: Describe the exception
  "Need to add validation package, increases bundle 5%"

Justification: Why is it worth the exception?
  "Adds critical SHACL support for 60% of users"

Trade-off: What are we giving up?
  "Removes dark matter optimization (used by 5%)"

Approval: Sign-off from architecture + product
  [ ] Architecture approves
  [ ] Product confirms user value
  [ ] Exception documented in git commit

Duration: Is this temporary or permanent?
  "Permanent: validation in core, dark matter moves to unrdf-advanced"

Outcome: New baseline established
  "New bundle limit: 1.1 MB (was 1.0 MB)"
```

## 10. Sustaining v5 Long-Term

### Anti-Bloat Culture

**Team Practices**:
1. **Every feature removal is celebrated** (not seen as loss)
2. **Simplicity is valued** (over featurism)
3. **80/20 is enforced** (80% value from 20% features)
4. **Separation is preferred** (optional packages over core bloat)
5. **User focus** (what 80% need, not what 1% request)

### Metrics as Culture

**Post metrics on walls**, show them in meetings:
- "Core package: 35,000 LOC"
- "Essential exports: 70 functions"
- "Bundle size: 998 KB"
- "User onboarding: 5 minutes"

**Celebrate when metrics hold steady**:
- "Week 1 of v5: All metrics on target! 🎉"
- "Month 2: Bundle still <1 MB, downloads at 1,200/week 📈"

**Alert when metrics drift**:
- "Alert: LOC increased to 35,500 (+500 over target)"
- "⚠️ Bundle increased to 1.02 MB, review recent PRs"
