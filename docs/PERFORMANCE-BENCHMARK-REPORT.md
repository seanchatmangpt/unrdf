## 6. Scaling Characteristics

### Horizontal Scalability

- **Effect Execution**: Linear scaling (isolate-per-effect)

- **API Endpoints**: Standard HTTP scaling (load balancer + replicas)

### Vertical Scalability

- **Memory**: 128MB per effect isolate allows ~60 concurrent effects per 8GB server
- **CPU**: Each effect execution is single-threaded; multi-core benefits from concurrency
- **Throughput**: 100+ tx/sec per instance; 1000+ tx/sec with 10 instances

### Resource Limits

| Resource | Current Limit | Scaling Factor | Notes |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Effect Isolates | 128MB each | Linear | ~60 per 8GB server |
| Transaction Throughput | 100+ tx/sec | Linear | Scale horizontally |
| API Requests | 160+ req/sec | Linear | Standard HTTP scaling |
| OTel Overhead | 6MB + 3% CPU | Constant | Minimal impact |
