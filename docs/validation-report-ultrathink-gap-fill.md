## Critical Blockers (P0 - Production Stoppers)

### 1. Store Query Completely Broken
**Status:** ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE
**Impact:** HIGH - Core RDF query functionality non-operational
**Occurrences:** 6+ failures across multiple tests

**Error:**
```
‚ùå Query failed: urn:comunica:default:query-source-identify/mediators#main
mediated over all rejecting actors:
- urn:comunica:default:query-source-identify/actors#rdfjs requires a
  single query source with rdfjs type to be present in the context.
- urn:comunica:default:query-source-identify/actors#serialized requires
  a single query source with serialized type to be present in the context.
- urn:comunica:default:query-source-identify/actors#hypermedia requires
  a single query source with a URL value to be present in the context.
```

**Root Cause:** Comunica query engine not properly configured with query sources

**Affected Tests:**
- P0: Graph lifecycle workflow (Step 3/5)
- P1: Sidecar gRPC communication (Step 2/3)
- All SPARQL query operations

**Fix Required:** Configure Comunica with proper RDF/JS source context

---

### 2. Hook Create File Path Resolution Failure
**Status:** ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE
**Impact:** HIGH - Knowledge Hooks system non-functional
**Occurrences:** 18 failures

**Error:**
```
‚ùå hook create: File not found: hooks/health-check.json
```

**Root Cause:** Hook create command writes to wrong directory or expects existing file

**Affected Tests:**
- P0: Hook evaluation workflow
- P1: Graph lifecycle with hooks
- P1: Hook veto scenarios
- P1: Hook performance benchmarks

**Fix Required:**
- Correct hook file path resolution
- Create hooks directory if missing
- Fix hook create to generate JSON files properly

---

### 3. Policy Validate Missing Required Argument
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FIXED (requires validation)
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Policy compliance validation broken
**Occurrences:** 12 failures

**Error:**
```
[error] Missing required argument: --policy
```

**Root Cause:** CLI argument definition inconsistent with implementation

**Recent Change Detected:**
```javascript
// File: cli/unrdf.mjs (modified during session)
validate: defineCommand({
  args: {
    policy: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Policy pack name (optional, uses last applied)',
      required: false  // ‚Üê Changed from required: true
    }
  }
})
```

**Status:** Change made but not validated - **requires re-testing**

**Affected Tests:**
- P0: Policy enforcement (Step 2/3)
- P1: Policy violation detection
- P1: Policy performance validation

---

### 4. Hook Evaluation File Not Found
**Status:** ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Hook execution system broken
**Occurrences:** 6 failures

**Error:**
```
‚ùå Hook evaluation failed: Failed to load hook:
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'perf-hook'
```

**Root Cause:** Hook eval command cannot locate hooks created by hook create

**Fix Required:** Align hook create and hook eval file path resolution

---

### 5. Sidecar Health Check Pattern Mismatch
**Status:** ‚ùå FAILURE
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Sidecar integration validation broken
**Occurrences:** 3 failures

**Error:**
```
Step failed: Output does not match expected pattern: /Status: (healthy|ready|ok)/i
```

**Root Cause:** Sidecar health endpoint output format doesn't match test expectations

**Fix Required:** Update sidecar health output or test expectations

---

## Major Issues (P1 - Functionality Broken)

### 6. Policy Audit Log Format Mismatch
**Status:** ‚ùå FAILURE
**Impact:** LOW - Audit logging format inconsistent
**Occurrences:** 3 failures

**Error:**
```
Step failed: Output does not match expected pattern: /\d+ violations?/
```

**Affected Tests:**
- P1: Policy violation detection (Step 3/3)

---

### 7. Performance Target Miss
**Status:** ‚ùå FAILURE
**Impact:** LOW - Performance below targets

**Error:**
```
√ó expected 10162 to be less than 5000
√ó expected 10104 to be less than 5000
√ó expected 10147 to be less than 5000
```

**Analysis:** Concurrent graph operations took ~10 seconds vs 5 second target
**Note:** Test still passed functionally, only performance assertion failed

---

### 8. OTEL Trace Propagation Issues
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
**Impact:** LOW - Observability data incomplete

**Warning:**
```
Failed to fetch traces for <trace-id> from Jaeger:
Jaeger API error: 404 Not Found
‚ö†Ô∏è  No traces found for trace ID: <trace-id>
```

**Analysis:** OTEL traces not reaching Jaeger within test timeframe

---

## Fixes That Worked

### ‚úÖ Policy Validate Argument Change (Requires Validation)
**File:** cli/unrdf.mjs
**Change:** Made `--policy` argument optional instead of required

**Code:**
```javascript
policy: {
  type: 'string',
  description: 'Policy pack name (optional, uses last applied)',
  required: false  // Changed from true
}
```

**Status:** Changed but NOT validated by test re-run
**Next Step:** Re-run tests to confirm fix works

---

## Fixes That Did NOT Work

### ‚ùå Store Query (Still Broken)
- No fix attempted or applied
- Comunica configuration remains broken

### ‚ùå Hook Create (Still Broken)
- No fix attempted or applied
- File path resolution remains broken

### ‚ùå Hook Eval (Still Broken)
- No fix attempted or applied
- Hook loading remains broken

---

## Remaining Critical Issues

### Immediate Action Required

1. **FIX STORE QUERY (P0 - CRITICAL)**
   - Configure Comunica with proper query sources
   - Add RDF/JS source context to query engine
   - Implement proper source identification

2. **FIX HOOK CREATE (P0 - CRITICAL)**
   - Create hooks directory if missing
   - Fix file path resolution for hook JSON files
   - Ensure hook create writes to correct location

3. **FIX HOOK EVAL (P0 - CRITICAL)**
   - Align hook eval file path with hook create
   - Add proper error handling for missing hooks
   - Implement hook file discovery logic

4. **VALIDATE POLICY FIX (P1 - HIGH)**
   - Re-run tests with new policy validate code
   - Confirm --policy is truly optional
   - Verify default behavior (use last applied pack)

5. **FIX SIDECAR HEALTH (P1 - MEDIUM)**
   - Align health check output format with test expectations
   - OR update test pattern to match actual output

---

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Current Grade: **F (FAIL)**

**Justification:**
- 0% pass rate on P0 critical workflows
- Core RDF query functionality completely broken
- Knowledge Hooks system non-functional
- Policy validation partially broken
- Test suite unable to complete due to timeout

### Blockers to Production:
1. ‚ùå Store query must work for ANY production use
2. ‚ùå Hook create/eval must work for Knowledge Hooks feature
3. ‚ùå Policy validate must work for compliance enforcement
4. ‚ùå Test suite must complete without timeout

### Estimated Work Required:
- **Store Query Fix:** 4-8 hours (Comunica configuration research + implementation)
- **Hook System Fix:** 2-4 hours (file path resolution + testing)
- **Policy Validate Validation:** 30 minutes (re-run tests)
- **Sidecar Health Fix:** 1-2 hours (output format alignment)
- **Performance Optimization:** 4-8 hours (investigate 10s vs 5s target)

**Total Estimated Effort:** 12-23 hours of focused development work

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. **Re-run tests** to validate policy fix
2. **Fix store query** - blocks ALL RDF operations
3. **Fix hook create/eval** - blocks Knowledge Hooks feature

### Short-term (This Week)
4. Implement proper Comunica source configuration
5. Add integration tests for hook file operations
6. Optimize concurrent operation performance
7. Fix sidecar health check format

### Long-term (This Sprint)
8. Add comprehensive error handling for all CLI commands
9. Implement proper file path resolution utilities
10. Add performance benchmarking to CI/CD
11. Document all CLI argument requirements

---

## Conclusion

**AGENTS DID NOT COMPLETE THEIR WORK SUCCESSFULLY**

Despite some basic operations working (graph create, store import, policy apply), the system has **multiple critical blockers** that prevent production deployment:

- **Store query completely broken** - Comunica misconfigured
- **Hook system non-functional** - File path resolution broken
- **Policy validation partially broken** - Fix applied but not validated
- **Test suite incomplete** - Timed out at 120 seconds

**The system requires significant additional work before it can be considered production-ready.**

### Next Steps:
1. Address P0 critical blockers (query, hooks)
2. Validate P1 policy fix via test re-run
3. Re-run full test suite to completion
4. Achieve minimum 80% P0 pass rate before production consideration
