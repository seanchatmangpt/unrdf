/**
 * @file 80/20 Knowledge Hook definition contract for autonomic systems.
 * @module newco/defineHook
 *
 * @description
 * This module provides the `defineHook` function, the sole entry point for
 * defining a Knowledge Hook. The contract enforces critical principles for
 * autonomic, deterministic, and provable systems:
 *
 * 1.  **Conditions are Addressed, Not Embedded**: The `when` clause MUST
 * reference an external, content-addressed SPARQL or SHACL file.
 * This forbids inline query strings, ensuring that governance logic is
 * a verifiable, standalone artifact.
 *
 * 2.  **Reflex Arc Lifecycle**: The `before`, `run`, and `after` functions
 * provide a minimal, complete lifecycle for autonomic reflexes:
 * - `before`: A pre-condition gate for payload normalization or cancellation.
 * - `run`: The core effect or analysis.
 * - `after`: A post-execution step for auditing and cleanup.
 *
 * 3.  **Declarative Configuration**: Determinism and receipting strategies
 * are declared as metadata, not implemented imperatively within the hook.
 *
 * 4.  **Comprehensive Validation**: Uses Zod schemas for complete type safety
 * and validation of all hook components.
 *
 * This API is designed to feel familiar to users of Nitro's `defineTask`
 * while being fundamentally adapted for a knowledge-native, policy-first runtime.
