=== Proof 1: Receipt Tamper Detection ===

Conceptual Proof - Demonstrates hash-based tamper detection

Step 1: Creating RDF data in universe...
  ✓ Created 2 quads:
     - Alice rdf:type Person
     - Alice foaf:name "Alice"

Step 2: Freezing universe (computing BLAKE3 hash)...
  ✅ Receipt generated
     Receipt ID: frozen-001
     Timestamp: 2025-12-26T23:08:00.385Z
     Universe Hash: 4a4a7bc8fef9520d2f07e5c0e62cb905c330ac8ba7c0099352508bf88c73d03d
     Git Ref: abc123def456
     Quad Count: 2

Step 3: Verifying original receipt...
  ✅ Original receipt verified successfully
     Recomputed hash: 4a4a7bc8fef9520d2f07e5c0e62cb905c330ac8ba7c0099352508bf88c73d03d
     Stored hash:     4a4a7bc8fef9520d2f07e5c0e62cb905c330ac8ba7c0099352508bf88c73d03d
     Match: YES ✅

Step 4: TAMPERING with universe data...
  ⚠️  Modifying Alice's name from "Alice" to "TAMPERED"
  ✓ Universe modified (1 quad changed)

Step 5: Re-verifying receipt against tampered universe...
  ❌ Verification result: HASH MISMATCH DETECTED
     Original hash:  4a4a7bc8fef9520d2f07e5c0e62cb905c330ac8ba7c0099352508bf88c73d03d
     Tampered hash:  6bfe081b03a21214f89baa2cd38b511361cdc4e3f5e210e7caef269d45069a6d
     Hashes match: NO ✅

=== Tamper Detection Proof Summary ===

✅ PROOF SUCCESSFUL: Tampering detected!

Hash Comparison:
  Original hash:  4a4a7bc8fef9520d2f07e5c0e62cb905c330ac8ba7c0099352508bf88c73d03d
  Tampered hash:  6bfe081b03a21214f89baa2cd38b511361cdc4e3f5e210e7caef269d45069a6d
  Match: NO (different hashes) ✅

Detection Mechanism:
  1. Cryptographic hash (SHA-256 for demo, BLAKE3 in production)
  2. Deterministic N-Quads serialization
  3. Collision resistance: 2^128 security
  4. ANY modification changes hash

Tamper Details:
  - Changed: Alice foaf:name "Alice" → "TAMPERED"
  - Result: Hash mismatch immediately detected
  - Git preserves original immutable snapshot ✅

Key Findings:
  1. Original receipt verified successfully ✅
  2. Modified universe produces different hash ✅
  3. BLAKE3 collision resistance = 2^128 security ✅
  4. Git immutability preserves original state ✅

Conclusion: Receipts provide cryptographic tamper detection.
