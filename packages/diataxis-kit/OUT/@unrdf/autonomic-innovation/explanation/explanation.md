## Concepts

- rdf
- autonomic
- swarm
- graph
- innovation

## Architecture

AUTONOMIC_INNOVATION is a fully autonomous, multi-agent system where 10 specialized agents work in parallel to build innovative RDF/graph primitives. Agent 1 (Orchestrator) provides the integration framework, while Agents 2-10 implement specific innovations.

## Tradeoffs

- Ease of use vs. advanced configuration options
