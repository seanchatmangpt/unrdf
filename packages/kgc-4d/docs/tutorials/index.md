# Tutorials

Tutorials are **learning-oriented guides** that introduce you to KGC 4D by doing. Each tutorial builds on the previous one and assumes no prior knowledge of the system.

## Tutorial Series

1. **[Getting Started](./01-getting-started.md)** (15 minutes)
   - Install dependencies
   - Create your first KGC Store
   - Perform a basic read/write operation
   - Run queries

2. **[Working with Events](./02-working-with-events.md)** (20 minutes)
   - Understand the event log model
   - Create events with payloads
   - Append events with mutations
   - Inspect event history

3. **[Temporal Snapshots](./03-temporal-snapshots.md)** (25 minutes)
   - Freeze the universe to Git
   - Create named snapshots
   - Reconstruct historical state
   - Verify snapshot integrity

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or a modern browser
- Basic understanding of RDF/triples (optional but helpful)
- Familiarity with async/await syntax
- Git installed locally (for tutorial 3)

## Learning Path

Follow the tutorials in order. Each builds on concepts from the previous tutorial:

```
Getting Started (core operations)
        ↓
Working with Events (event model)
        ↓
Temporal Snapshots (history and verification)
```

After completing tutorials, proceed to [How-To Guides](../how-to-guides/index.md) for task-specific instructions.
