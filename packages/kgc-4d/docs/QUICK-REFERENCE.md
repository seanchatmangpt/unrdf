## 🎯 Executive Summary (30 seconds)

| What | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Production Ready?** | ✅ YES |
| **Test Pass Rate** | 250/250 (100%) |
| **OTEL Validation** | 100/100 |
| **FMEA Risk** | 0 high-risk (28 modes, all controlled) |
| **Performance** | 1,173x hook overhead @ 10K ops |
| **Optimization Path** | Validation caching = 35% gain (15 min) |

---

## ⚡ Performance At a Glance

### Hook Latency (milliseconds)

| Operations | Baseline | Single Hook | 3 Hooks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 0.00ms | 0.23ms | 1.24ms |
| 100 | 0.00ms | 1.98ms | 29.41ms |
| 1K | 0.07ms | 4.48ms | 417.53ms |
| **10K** | **0.02ms** | **33.45ms** | **4,322.86ms** |

**Rule**: <1K = safe | 1K-10K = monitor | >10K = optimize first

---

## 🚀 Make/Break Decisions

### Deploy with <1K operations?
✅ **YES** - Safe to deploy now
- Latency: <50ms acceptable
- No special optimization needed
- See: DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md Phase 2

### Deploy with 1K-10K operations?
⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Must optimize first
1. Implement validation caching (35% improvement, 15 min)
2. Benchmark and verify targets met
3. Set up monitoring and alerts
4. Have rollback plan ready
- See: BENCHMARKS.md section 4.1.1 + DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md

### Deploy with >10K operations?
❌ **NO** - Optimize before deploying
1. Validation caching (required)
2. Fast-path for validation hooks (required)
3. Schema compilation (optional)
4. Target: <5s latency for 10K ops
5. Benchmark and verify
- See: BENCHMARKS.md section 4 (Optimization roadmap)

## 📊 Key Metrics Reference

### Test Coverage
```
Total Tests:        250/250 passing (100%)
Unit Tests:         250
Integration Tests:  Deep time-travel: 10 tests
OTEL Validation:    100/100 across 4 categories
Doctest Coverage:   48 embedded + validated
```

### Production Risk (FMEA)
```
Total Failure Modes:  28 identified
High Risk (RPN ≥100): 0
Medium Risk (RPN 50-99): 4 (all mitigated)
Low Risk (RPN <50):   24 (well-controlled)
Guards Implemented:   24 poka-yoke controls
Risk Score:           🟢 LOW (safe to deploy)
```

### Performance Baselines
```
Baseline (no hooks):       0.044μs per quad
Single hook overhead:      11.15μs per quad (+5,400%)
Zod validation cost:       ~10μs per hook execution
Hook registration:         0.063ms per hook (negligible)
Memory per hook:           9.9KB (scales well)
```

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### "Latency is too high"
1. Check operation count (Phase 2, DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md)
2. Is it >10K ops? → Must optimize (see below)
3. Implement validation caching (BENCHMARKS.md 4.1.1)
4. Measure improvement (should see 35% gain)
5. Still too high? → Implement fast-path (BENCHMARKS.md 4.1.2)

### "Performance targets not met"
1. Current latency: __________ ms
2. Target latency: __________ ms (from BENCHMARKS.md 5.1)
3. Gap: __________ ms
4. Operations count: __________
5. See BENCHMARKS.md section 4 (Optimization roadmap)

### "Production alert triggered"
1. What alert? (error rate, latency, memory?)
2. Check FMEA guard (reference/FMEA-PRODUCTION.md)
3. Mitigation strategy documented? Yes/No
4. Trigger rollback? Check Phase 9, DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md

### "OTEL validation failed"
1. Run: `npm run validate:otel` (if available)
2. Check score (need ≥80/100)
3. Review spans for errors
4. See reference/COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md Phase 5

## 💾 Hook Overhead Optimization Priorities

**Quick Wins (15 min → 35% gain):**
1. Cache validated hooks (Zod = 10μs bottleneck)
2. Verify 35% improvement
3. Proceed to deployment

**Medium Effort (1-2 hours → 5.8x total gain):**
1. Fast-path for validation-only hooks
2. Schema compilation
3. Benchmark again

**Long-term (requires research):**
1. Zod alternative (Valibot, Typia)
2. Hook pooling/reuse
3. Memory optimization
