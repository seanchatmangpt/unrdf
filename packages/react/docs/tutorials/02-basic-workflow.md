## Workflow Overview

The basic workflow consists of initialization, configuration, execution, and monitoring. Each step is important for reliable operation.

## Step 1: Initialization

Set up your instance with proper configuration. This happens once at application startup.

## Step 2: Configuration

Configure the instance for your specific use case. Different configurations optimize for different scenarios.

## Step 3: Data Operations

Perform your core data operations. These could be queries, updates, or bulk operations.

## Step 4: Monitoring

Track operation results and system health. Monitor for errors and unexpected behavior.

## Step 5: Cleanup

Properly clean up resources when done. This ensures no memory leaks or hanging connections.

## Practical Example

Here's a complete example showing the full workflow from start to finish.

## Error Handling

Always implement error handling in your code. Different errors require different responses.

## Performance Tips

- Batch operations when possible
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Monitor system resources
- Profile slow operations

## Common Patterns

The most common pattern combines initialization, configuration, execution in a try-catch block.

## Testing Your Workflow

Write tests to verify your workflow operates correctly under various conditions.
