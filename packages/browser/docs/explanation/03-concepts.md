## Key Concepts

Fundamental ideas behind @unrdf/browser:

## Concept 1: The Pipeline Model

Data flows through processing stages from input to output.

## Concept 2: Configuration as Control

All behavior controlled through configuration objects.

## Concept 3: Async Operations

All I/O is asynchronous for scalability and responsiveness.

## Mental Models

### Stream Model
Visualize continuous data flow through the system.

### Configuration Tree
Picture nested configuration controlling behavior.

### Event Stream
Think of operations producing events over time.

## Abstraction Levels

- High level: What is it doing?
- Middle level: How is work organized?
- Low level: How are operations implemented?
