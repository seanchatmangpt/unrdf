\section{Introduction}

This document tests the inclusion of external graphics files using the
\texttt{graphicx} package. The compilation pipeline must correctly resolve
image paths and include them in the final PDF output.

\section{Test Image}

Below is a test diagram included via \texttt{\\includegraphics}:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{diagram.png}
  \caption{Test diagram (PNG format)}
  \label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:diagram} demonstrates that the LaTeX compilation pipeline
can successfully process documents with embedded images.

\section{Requirements}

This test validates:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{graphicx} package loading
  \item Image file resolution from VFS
  \item Figure environment compilation
  \item Cross-reference to figure labels
  \item PNG format support
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The successful compilation of this document with the included image confirms
that the pure JavaScript LaTeX pipeline can handle graphics-heavy documents.
