## Advanced Concepts

This section covers sophisticated patterns used in production systems. These patterns enable high performance and reliability.

## Pattern: Streaming Data

Process large datasets without loading everything into memory. Streaming is essential for scalability.

## Pattern: Batch Operations

Combine multiple operations for better performance. Batching reduces overhead and improves throughput.

## Pattern: Caching

Cache results to avoid redundant computation. Intelligent caching dramatically improves performance.

## Pattern: Connection Pooling

Reuse connections across operations. Pooling improves resource utilization and reduces latency.

## Pattern: Circuit Breaker

Detect failures and stop cascading errors. Circuit breaker pattern improves system resilience.

## Pattern: Event Handling

Listen to events during operations. Events provide visibility into system behavior.

## Production Deployment

Deploying to production requires additional considerations beyond basic operation.

## Monitoring and Observability

Implement comprehensive monitoring to understand system behavior in production.

## Scaling Strategies

Different scaling strategies work for different scenarios. Choose based on your requirements.

## Performance Optimization

Optimize performance by profiling, identifying bottlenecks, and applying targeted fixes.

## Security Considerations

Implement security best practices when deploying to production systems.
