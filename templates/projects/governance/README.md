# UNRDF Governance Project

A governance-focused UNRDF project template for data stewardship, compliance monitoring, and policy enforcement.

## Features

- Policy Pack management for governance rules
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Audit trail generation with cryptographic proofs
- Data stewardship workflows
- Access control and authorization

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Validate policies:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:policies
   ```

3. Run the governance system:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Run audit:
   ```bash
   npm run audit
   ```

5. Generate compliance report:
   ```bash
   npm run compliance:report
   ```

## Policy Packs

### Governance Policy Pack
- Data ownership validation
- Data classification enforcement
- Access control policies
- Audit trail generation

### Compliance Policy Pack
- GDPR compliance checks
- SOX financial controls
- Data retention policies
- Privacy controls

## Governance Roles

- **Data Steward**: Defines data quality standards and classifications
- **Data Owner**: Approves access policies and reviews audits
- **Compliance Officer**: Monitors compliance and generates reports
- **Security Manager**: Enforces security policies

## Audit Trail

All governance operations create immutable audit trails with:
- Timestamp
- Actor (who)
- Action (what)
- Resource (which data)
- Outcome (success/failure)
- Cryptographic proof

## Compliance Reporting

Automated reports include:
- Daily compliance summary
- Weekly audit reports
- Monthly governance metrics
- Quarterly comprehensive assessments

## Next Steps

1. Configure governance policies in `policy-packs/`
2. Define data stewardship roles in `data/roles.ttl`
3. Implement custom compliance hooks in `src/hooks/`
4. Set up automated compliance reporting
5. Integrate with your existing governance framework
