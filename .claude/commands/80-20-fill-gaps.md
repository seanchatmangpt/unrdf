# 80/20 Fill the Gaps - Capability Completion Workflow

## Purpose

This command enables agents to autonomously scan the codebase using 80/20 thinking, identify incomplete capabilities, finish them, validate them, and determine next steps. The agent uses the full context window to make strategic decisions and implements without asking for confirmation.

## Core Principle: 80/20 Thinking

**The 80/20 rule**: 20% of capabilities deliver 80% of value. Value includes quality, consistency, and maintainability - these are not optional. Focus on high-impact capabilities that provide maximum value while maintaining quality standards.

**Quality-First Principle (DfLSS Alignment)**:

- **Quality is HIGH VALUE**, not optional - design for quality from the start
- **Consistency is HIGH VALUE** - using project language (JavaScript in JavaScript project) is high value, not "extra effort"
- **Maintainability is HIGH VALUE** - code that's easy to maintain prevents defects and reduces technical debt
- **Prevent defects AND waste** - don't fix them later (DfLSS principle - addresses both efficiency and quality)
- Quality work may require more effort, but it's still high value because it prevents defects, maintains consistency, and improves maintainability

**Above-AGI thinking**:

- Use **full context window** to scan entire codebase
- Identify **incomplete capabilities** (not just bugs)
- Prioritize by **impact and value** (80/20 matrix) - where value includes quality, consistency, maintainability
- **Finish capabilities** completely with quality standards
- **Validate** implementations thoroughly
- **Determine next steps** strategically

## Workflow Overview

```
Step 1: 80/20 Scan → Step 2: Identify Incomplete Capabilities → Step 3: Finish Capabilities → Step 4: Validate → Step 5: Next Steps
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: 80/20 Scan

**Action**: Rapidly scan the codebase to identify incomplete capabilities using 80/20 thinking.

#### 1.1: Quick Context Scan

**Action**: Use full context window to scan codebase efficiently.

**Scan targets**:

- **Source files** (`src/**/*.mjs`) - Look for incomplete implementations
- **Test files** (`test/**/*.test.mjs`) - Look for missing test coverage
- **Examples** (`examples/**/*.mjs`) - Look for incomplete examples
- **Configuration** (`package.json`, `vitest.config.mjs`) - Look for incomplete features

**Action**: Scan systematically

```bash
# Quick scan for incomplete capabilities
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|unimplemented\|incomplete\|partial" src/ --include="*.mjs"
grep -r "describe\|it\|test" test/ --include="*.test.mjs" | wc -l  # Count test files
find src -name "*.mjs" | wc -l     # Count total modules
```

**Tool usage**: Use `grep`, `codebase_search`, `read_file` to quickly identify incomplete capabilities.

#### 1.2: Identify Capability Patterns

**Action**: Look for patterns that indicate incomplete capabilities.

**Capability indicators**:

1. **Incomplete features** - Features started but not finished
2. **Missing implementations** - Functions/types declared but not implemented
3. **Incomplete error handling** - Error paths not fully handled
4. **Incomplete type safety** - Types that could be more type-safe
5. **Incomplete tests** - Code without tests
6. **Incomplete validation** - Validation logic missing or incomplete

**Action**: Create capability inventory

```javascript
// Example: Identify incomplete capabilities
// 1. buildJson() uses try/catch without proper error propagation - incomplete error handling
// 2. Zod schemas only used in tests - incomplete adoption
// 3. Missing JSDoc types - incomplete documentation
// 4. Plain objects instead of Zod schemas - incomplete type safety
// 5. Runtime validation where Zod schemas could be used - incomplete optimization
```

---

### Step 2: Identify Incomplete Capabilities

**Action**: Identify capabilities that are incomplete and prioritize by 80/20.

#### 2.1: Capability Categories

**Action**: Categorize incomplete capabilities.

**Categories**:

1. **Error handling** - Incomplete error handling (e.g., try/catch without proper propagation)
2. **Type safety** - Incomplete type safety (e.g., plain objects instead of Zod schemas)
3. **Validation** - Incomplete validation (e.g., missing Zod validation schemas)
4. **Testing** - Incomplete test coverage (e.g., missing error path tests)
5. **Adoption** - Incomplete adoption (e.g., Zod schemas only used in tests)
6. **Documentation** - Missing JSDoc comments on public functions

**Action**: List incomplete capabilities

```markdown
## Incomplete Capabilities

### Error Handling

- buildJson() uses try/catch without proper error propagation (should throw or return error)
- Some error paths not fully handled
- Missing error handling in async functions

### Type Safety

- Plain objects instead of Zod schemas (should use Zod for validation)
- Missing JSDoc type annotations
- Runtime validation where Zod schemas could be used

### Validation

- Missing Zod validation schemas for function parameters
- Missing validation for API responses
- Incomplete input validation

### Testing

- Missing error path tests for some error variants
- Missing integration tests
- Missing test coverage for edge cases

### Adoption

- Zod schemas only used in tests (not production code)
- JSDoc types incomplete or missing

### Documentation

- Missing JSDoc comments on public functions
- Incomplete parameter documentation
```

#### 2.2: 80/20 Prioritization

**Action**: Prioritize capabilities by impact and value (where value includes quality, consistency, maintainability).

**80/20 Matrix** (Quality-First):

- **High Impact, High Value** (Quality Work) - Finish first - Quality, consistency, and maintainability are high value
- **High Impact, Medium Value** (Good Work) - Plan carefully - May require more effort but maintains quality
- **Low Impact, High Value** (Foundation Work) - Do when convenient - Quality foundations prevent future problems
- **Low Impact, Low Value** (Avoid) - Don't do - Not worth the effort

**Value Includes**:

- **Quality**: Code that works correctly, handles errors, follows patterns
- **Consistency**: Uses project language, follows project conventions, maintains patterns
- **Maintainability**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **Prevention**: Prevents defects and waste rather than fixing them later (DfLSS)

**Action**: Prioritize capabilities

```markdown
## Top 20% Capabilities (80% of Value - Quality First)

### High Impact, High Value (Quality Work - Do First)

1. Fix buildJson() to properly handle errors - Prevents silent failures, maintains error handling consistency
2. Add Zod validation schemas - Verifies input/output, maintains type safety
3. Use JavaScript in JavaScript project - Maintains consistency, prevents language mixing
4. Add JSDoc comments to all public functions - Prevents misuse, maintains documentation

### High Impact, Medium Value (Good Work - Plan)

5. Add comprehensive Zod schemas for all API boundaries - Runtime validation, maintains quality
6. Add error path tests - Complete test coverage, maintains quality standards

### Foundation Work (High Value, Lower Impact)

7. Migrate production code to use Zod schemas consistently - Incremental adoption, maintains consistency
```

---

### Step 3: Finish Capabilities

**Action**: Complete incomplete capabilities without asking for confirmation.

#### 3.1: Implementation Strategy

**Action**: Finish capabilities systematically.

**Implementation order**:

1. **Quick wins first** - Get immediate value
2. **Complete error handling** - Prevent bugs
3. **Complete type safety** - Prevent errors
4. **Complete validation** - Verify correctness
5. **Complete testing** - Ensure quality

**Action**: Implement fixes

```javascript
// Example: Finish buildJson() capability
// BEFORE: Incomplete (uses try/catch without proper error handling)
export function buildJson(data) {
  try {
    return JSON.stringify(data);
  } catch {
    return '{}'; // Silent failure
});
});
// AFTER: Complete (proper error handling)
/**
 * Build JSON string from data
 * @param {unknown} data - Data to stringify
 * @returns {string} JSON string
 * @throws {Error} If data cannot be stringified
 */
export function buildJson(data) {
  try {
    return JSON.stringify(data);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to stringify data: ${error.message}`);
});
});
```

#### 3.2: Capability Completion Checklist

## Expert Insights

**Why this matters**: Incomplete capabilities accumulate technical debt. Finishing capabilities completely prevents bugs and improves code quality.

**Key principle**: "80/20 thinking" - Focus on completing the 20% of capabilities that deliver 80% of value. Value includes quality, consistency, and maintainability - these are not optional. Quality work may require more effort, but it's still high value.

**Above-AGI thinking**: Use the full context window to make comprehensive decisions. Think strategically about impact and value (where value includes quality, consistency, maintainability). Finish capabilities completely with quality standards without asking for confirmation.

**Remember**:

- **Quality first** - Quality, consistency, and maintainability are high value, not optional
- **Finish completely** - Don't leave capabilities half-done - complete with quality standards
- **Validate thoroughly** - Ensure capabilities work correctly and maintain quality
- **Strategic next steps** - Plan what to do next based on 80/20 value (including quality)

**80/20 principle**: 20% of capabilities deliver 80% of value. Value includes quality, consistency, and maintainability. Complete those first while maintaining quality standards.

**DfLSS Alignment**: Design for Lean Six Sigma - addresses both efficiency (Lean waste elimination) AND quality (Six Sigma defect prevention) from the start. Prevent defects AND waste rather than fixing them later. Maintain consistency (e.g., JavaScript in JavaScript project, Zod for validation, JSDoc for types). Quality and efficiency are foundational value, not optional.

**Autonomous execution**: Once capabilities are identified and prioritized, finish them without asking. The agent has full context and can make informed decisions. Always prioritize quality, consistency, and maintainability.
