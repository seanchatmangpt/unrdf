# TRIZ Problem Solving - Multi-Step Workflow

## Purpose

This command guides agents through TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) methodology to find innovative solutions by identifying contradictions and applying inventive principles. TRIZ helps solve problems that seem impossible by resolving contradictions rather than compromising. Experts use TRIZ to find breakthrough solutions that eliminate trade-offs.

## Workflow Overview

```
Step 1: Define Problem → Step 2: Identify Contradictions → Step 3: Apply TRIZ Principles → Step 4: Generate Solutions → Step 5: Verify Solutions
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Define Problem

**Action**: Clearly define the problem and desired improvement.

**Problem definition format**:

- **What**: What needs to be improved?
- **Current state**: What is the current situation?
- **Desired state**: What do we want to achieve?
- **Constraints**: What constraints exist?

**Example problem definition**:

```markdown
## Problem Definition

**What**: Need to improve test execution speed while maintaining test coverage
**Current state**: Tests take 10 seconds, comprehensive coverage
**Desired state**: Tests take < 1 second, maintain same coverage
**Constraints**: Cannot reduce test coverage, must maintain accuracy
```

**Principle**: Clear problem definition enables contradiction identification.

### Step 2: Identify Contradictions

**Action**: Identify technical and physical contradictions in the problem.

#### 2.1: Identify Technical Contradiction

**Action**: Find where improving one parameter worsens another.

**Technical contradiction format**:

- **Improving**: What parameter are we trying to improve?
- **Worsening**: What parameter gets worse as a result?
- **Contradiction**: The conflict between improvements

**TRIZ parameters** (39 standard parameters):

- Speed, Force, Energy, Power, Loss of Energy
- Loss of Substance, Loss of Information, Loss of Time
- Quantity of Substance, Reliability, Accuracy
- Manufacturing Precision, Object-Generated Harmful Factors
- Manufacturing Ease, Operational Ease, Device Complexity
- Level of Automation, Productivity
- And more...

**Example technical contradiction**:

```markdown
## Technical Contradiction

**Improving**: Speed (test execution time)
**Worsening**: Loss of Information (test coverage)
**Contradiction**: Faster tests require fewer tests, reducing coverage
**TRIZ Parameters**:

- Improving: Parameter #9 (Speed)
- Worsening: Parameter #24 (Loss of Information)
```

#### 2.2: Identify Physical Contradiction

**Action**: Find where the same parameter needs opposite values.

**Physical contradiction format**:

- **Parameter**: What parameter has conflicting requirements?
- **Requirement 1**: What value is needed in one context?
- **Requirement 2**: What opposite value is needed in another context?
- **Contradiction**: Same parameter needs opposite values

**Example physical contradiction**:

```markdown
## Physical Contradiction

**Parameter**: Test execution parallelism
**Requirement 1**: Need sequential execution (for shared state)
**Requirement 2**: Need parallel execution (for speed)
**Contradiction**: Tests must run sequentially AND in parallel simultaneously
```

**Principle**: Contradictions reveal the core problem. Resolving contradictions leads to innovative solutions.

### Step 3: Apply TRIZ Principles

**Action**: Use TRIZ inventive principles to resolve contradictions.

#### 3.1: Use Contradiction Matrix (Technical Contradictions)

**Action**: Look up inventive principles using TRIZ contradiction matrix.

**Contradiction matrix**: 39x39 matrix mapping parameter pairs to inventive principles.

**Process**:

1. Identify improving parameter (row)
2. Identify worsening parameter (column)
3. Look up principles in matrix
4. Apply principles to generate solutions

**Example contradiction matrix lookup**:

```markdown
## Contradiction Matrix Lookup

**Improving**: Parameter #9 (Speed)
**Worsening**: Parameter #24 (Loss of Information)
**Matrix Cell**: [9, 24]
**Inventive Principles**:

- Principle #10 (Prior Action): Prepare tests in advance
- Principle #13 (The Other Way Round): Run tests in reverse order
- Principle #28 (Mechanics Substitution): Use parallel execution
- Principle #35 (Parameter Changes): Change test granularity
```

#### 3.2: Apply Separation Principles (Physical Contradictions)

**Action**: Use separation principles to resolve physical contradictions.

**Separation principles**:

1. **Separation in Space**: Parameter has different values in different spaces
2. **Separation in Time**: Parameter has different values at different times
3. **Separation in Condition**: Parameter has different values under different conditions
4. **Separation in Scale**: Parameter has different values at different scales

**Example separation**:

```markdown
## Physical Contradiction Resolution

**Contradiction**: Tests must run sequentially AND in parallel
**Separation Principle**: Separation in Condition
**Solution**: Run tests sequentially when shared state needed, parallel when independent
**Implementation**: Group tests by dependency, run groups in parallel, tests within group sequentially
```

### Step 4: Generate Solutions

**Action**: Generate innovative solutions based on TRIZ principles.

#### 4.1: Brainstorm Solutions

**Action**: Generate multiple solution ideas for each principle.

**Solution generation**:

- Apply each principle to the problem
- Generate concrete solution ideas
- Think creatively, don't limit to obvious solutions
- Consider combinations of principles

**Example solution generation**:

```markdown
## Solution Ideas

**From Principle #10 (Prior Action)**:

  **Score**: 8/10 - Strong candidate
```

#### 4.3: Select Best Solution

**Action**: Select the best solution(s) to implement.

**Selection criteria**:

- Highest impact
- Resolves contradiction completely
- Feasible to implement
- Acceptable risk

**Example selection**:

```markdown
## Selected Solution

**Solution**: Pre-compile test fixtures + Parallel execution + Smart test selection
**Rationale**:

- Combines multiple principles for maximum impact
- Resolves contradiction (speed + coverage)

### Step 5: Verify Solutions

**Action**: Verify that solutions resolve contradictions and improve the problem.

#### 5.1: Verify Contradiction Resolution

**Action**: Confirm that solution eliminates the contradiction.

**Verification questions**:

- Does solution improve the desired parameter?
- Does solution maintain or improve the other parameter?
- Is the contradiction resolved?

**Example verification**:

```javascript
// Solution: Pre-compile fixtures + parallel execution
// Verify: Speed improved AND coverage maintained

// Before: Sequential execution, 10 seconds
// After: Parallel execution, 1 second
// Coverage: Same tests run, same coverage ✅

// Contradiction resolved: Speed improved without losing coverage
```

#### 5.2: Test Solution

**Action**: Implement and test the solution.

**Testing steps**:

1. Implement solution
2. Run tests: `pnpm test`
3. Measure improvement
4. Verify no regressions

**Example test**:

```bash
# Test solution
pnpm test

# Measure execution time
time pnpm test
# Before: 10.0s
# After: 1.2s ✅

# Verify coverage maintained
pnpm test-coverage
# Coverage: Same as before ✅
```

#### 5.3: Create Todo List for Solution Implementation

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT write documents or reports. Create todos and execute them.

**Action**: Create 10+ item todo list for implementing solution.

**Todo list creation**:

1. Create todos for solution implementation steps
2. Create todos for verification steps
3. Create todos for prevention measures
4. Prioritize by impact
5. Execute todos systematically

**Example todo list**:

```markdown
## TRIZ Solution Implementation Todos (10+ items)

**Solution Implementation**:

- [ ] Implement pre-compilation of test fixtures
- [ ] Add fixture caching mechanism
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution
- [ ] Add test dependency analysis
- [ ] Group tests by dependency
- [ ] Run independent test groups in parallel
- [ ] Run dependent tests sequentially within groups
- [ ] Add test execution time measurement
- [ ] Verify compilation: `pnpm lint`
- [ ] Run tests: `pnpm test`

**Verification**:

- [ ] Measure execution time improvement
- [ ] Verify test coverage maintained
- [ ] Verify no test failures
- [ ] Verify contradiction resolved (speed + coverage)

**Prevention**:

- [ ] Add test for parallel execution correctness
- [ ] Add test for fixture caching
- [ ] Document solution approach
- [ ] Add monitoring for test execution time
```

**Execution**:

1. Create todos using `todo_write` tool (10+ items minimum)
2. Execute todos one by one (implement solution)
3. Mark todos as completed as work is done
4. Verify each step works before moving to next
5. Continue until all todos complete

**Principle**: Execute solutions, don't document them. Todos track progress, solutions resolve contradictions.

## Expert Insights

**Why this matters**: Traditional problem-solving often involves compromise. TRIZ helps find solutions that eliminate contradictions, leading to breakthrough improvements.

**Key principle**: "Resolve contradictions, don't compromise" - TRIZ finds solutions that improve all parameters, not trade-offs.

**Remember**:

- **Contradictions reveal opportunities** - Where there's a contradiction, there's potential for innovation
- **Principles guide solutions** - 40 principles provide systematic approach to innovation
- **Breakthrough solutions** - TRIZ finds solutions that seem impossible but eliminate contradictions

**TRIZ mindset**: Don't accept trade-offs. Find solutions that improve everything. Contradictions are opportunities, not limitations.

**DfLSS alignment**: TRIZ supports DfLSS (Design for Lean Six Sigma) by finding solutions that address both efficiency (waste elimination) AND quality (defect prevention) simultaneously - eliminating contradictions rather than compromising. Don't conflate DfLSS with DFSS (Design for Six Sigma) - DFSS only addresses quality, missing critical waste elimination. See [Root Cause Analysis - DfLSS vs DFSS](./root-cause-analysis.md#dflss-vs-dfss-critical-distinction) for why conflating DfLSS with DFSS is a huge error.

## Command Execution Pattern

**CRITICAL**: TRIZ commands must:

1. **Create 10+ item todo list** - Not documents/reports
2. **Execute todos** - Implement solutions, not document them
3. **Verify solutions** - Test that solutions resolve contradictions
4. **Complete todos** - Mark todos as done as solutions complete

**Principle**: Execute solutions that resolve contradictions, don't document them. Todos track progress, solutions eliminate contradictions.
