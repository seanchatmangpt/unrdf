GATE 1: BUILD STATUS

Issues Found:
1. unbuild not installed (FIXED - installed to workspace root)
2. kgc-docs missing docs/src directory (FIXED - created directory)
3. CLI package.json exports mismatch - references non-existent index.mjs (BLOCKER)

Core Packages (v6-core, decision-fabric, streaming, hooks, federation):
- NO build scripts (pure ESM modules)
- Import directly from src/
- NOT affected by build failures

Build Partial Success:
- atomvm: Built successfully
- kgc-docs: Built successfully (0 files processed)
- graph-analytics: Building (in progress when CLI failed)
- CLI: FAILED - export configuration mismatch
- docs, nextra: Blocked by CLI failure

Verdict: Build failures are in non-core packages. Core functionality (v6-core fixes) does not require build step.
