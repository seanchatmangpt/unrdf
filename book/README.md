## 🎯 Key Features

### 5 Breakthrough Innovations

1. **Reactive Knowledge Graphs** - Real-time UI updates from RDF changes
2. **Type-Safe SPARQL** - End-to-end type safety with Zod
3. **Edge-First Semantic Search** - <50ms global query latency
4. **Autonomous Data Governance** - Self-validating knowledge graphs
5. **Distributed Knowledge Federation** - Multi-region consensus protocols

### 80/20 Dark Matter Management

Learn how to eliminate the 80% of boilerplate code that delivers only 20% of value:

- Identify dark matter in your codebase
- Refactor away unnecessary complexity
- Focus on high-value business features
- Achieve 80% value with 20% code

### Full 360° Library Coverage

Master every UNRDF API:
- Knowledge Engine & Transaction Management
- Knowledge Hooks (Pre/Post-transaction)
- Browser Integration (IndexedDB, React Hooks)
- Policy Packs & Validation
- Streaming & Real-time Updates
- Distributed Systems & Federation
