## Key Validation Criteria

### ‚úÖ Completed in knowd
- [x] Basic RDF parsing (Turtle/N-Triples) with `knakk/rdf` library
- [x] SPARQL query execution with advanced constructs
- [x] SHACL validation framework
- [x] Cryptographic provenance via lockchain
- [x] HTTP REST API endpoints
- [x] In-memory RDF store operations

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Knowledge hooks system implementation
- [ ] Advanced SHACL constraints (OR/XONE)
- [ ] Plugin system architecture

### ‚ùå Missing/Planned
- [ ] Vector similarity search (HNSW)
- [ ] WASM effect execution sandboxing
- [ ] Cluster federation architecture
- [ ] Remote storage integrations
- [ ] OpenTelemetry observability
- [ ] mTLS authentication system

## Validation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Feature Parity (Critical Priority)
Focus on KNOWD-101, KNOWD-105, KNOWD-113 to establish baseline functionality

### Phase 2: Extended Features (High Priority)  
Implement KNOWD-102, KNOWD-103, KNOWD-104, KNOWD-107, KNOWD-112

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Medium Priority)
Complete KNOWD-106, KNOWD-108, KNOWD-109, KNOWD-111

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (All Priorities)
Execute KNOWD-115, KNOWD-116, KNOWD-117, KNOWD-118

## Performance Targets

Based on unrdf v3.0.3 benchmarks:

- **Hook Execution:** <100ms p95 latency (target: 50% improvement from baseline)
- **Query Optimization:** <500ms p95 latency (target: 60% improvement)  
- **Transaction Commit:** <500ms p95 latency (target: 20% improvement)
- **Cache Hit Rate:** 50%+ after warmup period

## Security Requirements

- SHA3-256 Merkle verification for audit trails
- Ed25519 cryptographic signatures for receipts
- Secure sandboxing for hook effects
- Input validation and sanitization
- mTLS support for production deployments

## Migration Strategy

1. **Compatibility Testing:** Validate data format compatibility
2. **API Mapping:** Ensure REST API parity  
3. **Performance Validation:** Meet or exceed unrdf benchmarks
4. **Feature Completeness:** Implement all core functionality

This validation ensures knowd achieves full feature parity with unrdf v3.0.3 while maintaining the performance and security benefits of the Go implementation.

## Usage

To use these tickets:

1. Import into your project management system (Jira, GitHub Issues, etc.)
2. Prioritize based on critical path dependencies
3. Assign estimates based on team velocity
4. Track progress against acceptance criteria
5. Update completeness as validation progresses

**Total Estimated Effort:** 167 story points across 18 feature areas
**Target Completion:** Complete feature parity validation with unrdf v3.0.3
