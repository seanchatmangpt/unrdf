# JIRA Feature Parity Tracking System

This directory contains tools for tracking and validating feature parity between the Go implementation (`knowd`) and the JavaScript implementation (`unrdf v3.0.3`).

## Overview

The JIRA WIP tracking system provides:
- **Automated validation** of implemented features against requirements
- **Progress reporting** with detailed status breakdowns
- **Ticket status management** for ongoing development tracking
- **Integration** with the main `knowd` binary for easy access

## Quick Start

### 1. Validate Current Status
```bash
# Check which features are implemented
./jira-status.sh validate
```

### 2. Generate Detailed Report
```bash
# Generate comprehensive feature parity report
./jira-status.sh report
```

### 3. Update Ticket Status
```bash
# Update a specific ticket's implementation status
./jira-status.sh update KNOWD-116:implemented:"Added migration documentation"
```

### 4. Using Direct Commands
```bash
# Direct binary commands (alternative to script)
./knowd -jira-validate
./knowd -jira-report
./knowd -jira-update "KNOWD-116:implemented:Added migration docs"
```

## Current Status Summary

As of the latest validation:

- **‚úÖ 16/18 features implemented** (88.9% complete)
- **üîÑ 0 features partially implemented**
- **‚ùå 2 features not implemented** (migration docs, benchmarks)

### Key Features Validated ‚úÖ
- Core RDF engine with SPARQL support
- Knowledge hooks system
- SHACL validation
- Cryptographic provenance (lockchain)
- REST API endpoints
- Observability (OpenTelemetry)
- Namespace isolation
- Cluster functionality
- Vector search (HNSW)
- WASM execution
- Remote storage
- Performance optimizations
- Security hardening
- mTLS authentication
- Integration tests
- Documentation

### Remaining Work ‚ùå
- **KNOWD-116**: Migration & compatibility documentation
- **KNOWD-118**: Performance benchmarking suite

## Command Reference

### Validation Commands
- `./jira-status.sh validate` - Check current implementation status
- `./knowd -jira-validate` - Same as above (direct binary)

### Reporting Commands
- `./jira-status.sh report` - Generate detailed status report
- `./knowd -jira-report` - Same as above (direct binary)

### Update Commands
- `./jira-status.sh update TICKET_ID:STATUS:NOTES`
- `./knowd -jira-update "TICKET_ID:STATUS:NOTES"`

### Status Values
- `implemented` - Feature is fully implemented
- `partial` - Feature is partially implemented
- `not_implemented` - Feature is not yet implemented

## Integration with Development Workflow

### For Developers
1. **Before starting work**: Run `./jira-status.sh validate` to see current status
2. **During development**: Update ticket status as features are completed
3. **After completing features**: Run validation to ensure detection works
4. **Before releases**: Generate final report for release notes

### For Project Managers
1. **Track progress**: Use `./jira-status.sh report` for status updates
2. **Identify gaps**: Check which features need attention
3. **Plan sprints**: Use priority and estimate data for planning
4. **Monitor completion**: Track percentage completion over time

## Technical Details

### Implementation
The JIRA system is implemented in Go and integrated into the main `knowd` binary. It:
- Parses markdown ticket definitions using regex patterns
- Validates implementation status by checking for key files and features
- Generates markdown reports with progress tracking
- Supports manual status overrides for complex validation cases

### Validation Logic
Each ticket has automated validation logic that checks for:
- Presence of key implementation files
- Configuration and setup completeness
- Test coverage where applicable
- Documentation availability

### Customization
The validation logic can be extended by modifying the `validate*()` methods in `cmd/knowd/jira.go` to add custom checks for specific features.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Loaded 0 JIRA tickets"**
- Check that `docs/jira/feature-parity-tickets.md` exists
- Verify the markdown format matches expected patterns

**Features not detected as implemented**
- Check if the validation logic correctly identifies your implementation
- Consider adding custom validation logic for complex features

**Report generation fails**
- Ensure write permissions for the `docs/jira/` directory
- Check that the main binary compiled successfully

### Getting Help
For issues with the JIRA tracking system:
1. Check the generated `feature-parity-status.md` for clues
2. Review the validation logic in `cmd/knowd/jira.go`
3. Test individual validation methods if needed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the JIRA system:
- **Automated testing integration** - Run actual tests as part of validation
- **Performance benchmarks** - Include performance validation in reports
- **CI/CD integration** - Generate reports in build pipelines
- **Web dashboard** - HTML report generation for better visualization
- **Historical tracking** - Track status changes over time
