# Introduction

This paper introduces a novel computational paradigm that departs from traditional discrete-state models, proposing a continuous, field-based framework for intelligent systems. We formalize this paradigm through the concept of "Knowledge Hooks"â€”global information vectors whose interactions define system state and drive behavior. We present unrdf, an autonomic knowledge framework, as the canonical implementation of this theory, featuring declarative governance, cryptographic provenance, and multi-agent coordination. Through applications in high-performance computing and enterprise automation, we demonstrate the framework's capacity to mechanize complex knowledge work. We conclude with a strategic analysis, positioning this approach as a "Blue Ocean" innovation that redefines the economics of software development by eliminating the "dark matter" of bespoke integration and manual governance, paving the way for the autonomic enterprise.
