Part III: High-Performance Applications and Deterministic Execution

The theoretical elegance and architectural novelty of the field-based framework must be matched by practical, real-world performance. This part grounds the discussion in the demanding domain of ultra-low-latency systems, using high-frequency trading as a case study to prove the framework's performance characteristics. It then dissects the specific computational techniques required to achieve the determinism and fault tolerance that are the bedrock of verifiable trust.
