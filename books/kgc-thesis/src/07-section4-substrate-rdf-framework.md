4. The New Timescale
Traditional AI systems like AlphaStar (gaming) or enterprise RPA (process automation) require heavy computation and warm-up.
KGC operates on a different timescale:

Can react within microseconds.

Hooks and rules are lightweight, branchless, and designed for FPGA/ASIC hardware acceleration.

Enables decision-making thatâ€™s orders of magnitude faster than competitors.
