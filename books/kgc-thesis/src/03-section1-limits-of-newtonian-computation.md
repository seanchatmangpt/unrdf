1. The Core Concept
Graph Text: Instead of treating data as rows in a database or code in a program, everything—facts, relationships, policies, and even logic—gets represented as a graph of knowledge.

Knowledge Geometry Calculus (KGC): A mathematical way of organizing and reasoning about those graphs so that the system can “think” reactively (respond to events) and proactively (plan ahead).

Why it matters: This shifts computing away from “glue code” and static programming toward self-governing, adaptive systems.
