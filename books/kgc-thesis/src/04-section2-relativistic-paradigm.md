Efficiency: 80% of software logic (the “dark matter” of hidden, repetitive code) can be replaced with graph-based knowledge hooks.

Coordination: Multiple systems, agents, or even people can operate in real-time with shared understanding—perfect for multiplayer scenarios (e.g., finance, games, supply chain).

Compliance & Trust: Every action can be cryptographically signed and auditable—crucial for governance, finance, and defense.

Agility: Changes to rules, policies, or strategies don’t require re-coding—just update the graph.
