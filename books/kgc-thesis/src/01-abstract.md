# Abstract

We present the **Knowledge Geometry Calculus (KGC)**, a formal calculus for reactive knowledge systems that executes in bounded microtime.

**Core Formalism**: A knowledge state is a canonically hashed, typed graph; hooks are guarded, effectful morphisms on that state; deltas are elements of an idempotent semiring; windows provide temporal geometry; and policy packs form a complete lattice of constraints.

**Performance Guarantees**: Under a constant-time dispatch and L1-cache cost model, we prove small-step determinism and an 8-primitive bound ("Chatman Constant") per reaction, yielding microsecond-class closed-loop control.

**Theoretical Contributions**: We establish algebraic laws, operational semantics, and complexity bounds sufficient to justify branchless compilationâ€”all without exhibiting implementation code.

**Practical Impact**: This theoretical foundation enables the first autonomic RDF framework capable of real-time governance, cryptographic auditability, and deterministic execution at microsecond timescales. Applications range from ultra-high-frequency trading to enterprise compliance automation, validating the shift from discrete-state "Newtonian" computation to continuous "relativistic" information fields.
