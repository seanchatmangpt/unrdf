## 7. Known Gaps & Missing Features

### 7.1 Features Missing in Extension (Present in CLI)

1. **Tab Completion**: No autocomplete for slash commands, file paths
2. **! Bash Shortcut**: Can't use `!command` for direct shell execution
3. **Advanced Slash Commands**: Subset of CLI commands available
4. **Command Aliases**: Can't create custom command shortcuts
5. **Full Logging Control**: Limited log level configuration
6. **Glob-based @-mentions**: Manual typing required for patterns
7. **Custom Configuration**: Some CLI-only config options

**Impact**: Moderate - power users miss keyboard efficiency
**Workaround**: Use CLI for these specific tasks

---

### 7.2 Features Missing in CLI (Present in Extension)

5. **Multi-Tab Conversations**: Requires separate terminal windows
6. **Click to Navigate**: Must manually open files
7. **Integrated Workspace**: Separate from code editing

**Impact**: Significant - visual review is core extension value
**Workaround**: Use extension for review-heavy workflows

---

### 7.3 Features Missing in Both

1. **Conversation Export**: Can't save/share as markdown
2. **Checkpoints**: Not yet released
3. **Plan Templates**: Can't save reusable plans
4. **Per-File Permissions**: Granular permission control

---

## 9. Decision Matrix: Which Interface to Use?

### 9.1 Use CLI When...

✅ **Automation**: Integrating Claude Code into scripts or CI/CD
✅ **Speed**: Quick fixes where keyboard efficiency matters
✅ **Headless**: Running on servers without GUI
✅ **SSH/Remote**: Working on remote machines
✅ **Resource-Constrained**: Limited memory/CPU available
✅ **Bulk Operations**: Scripting multiple file operations
✅ **MCP Management**: Configuring MCP servers
✅ **Power User**: Comfortable with terminal workflows

**Example Scenarios**:
- CI/CD pipeline for automated code review
- SSH into production server for quick fix
- Batch processing 50+ files
- Setting up new MCP integration

---

### 9.2 Use Extension When...

✅ **Visual Review**: Need to see diffs side-by-side
✅ **Plan Mode**: Complex changes requiring step approval
✅ **Learning**: New to Claude Code
✅ **Collaboration**: Screen sharing or pair programming
✅ **Exploration**: Browsing codebase interactively
✅ **Teaching**: Demonstrating Claude Code to others
✅ **Context Switching**: Want to stay in VS Code
✅ **File Navigation**: Need to jump to specific code locations

**Example Scenarios**:
- Complex refactoring with multiple file changes
- Teaching junior developer how to use Claude Code
- Reviewing AI-proposed architecture changes
- Quickly adding AI assistance to existing VS Code workflow

---

### 9.3 Use Both (Hybrid) When...

✅ **Setup + Execution**: CLI for MCP config, extension for usage
✅ **Rapid Iteration + Review**: CLI for speed, extension for final review
✅ **Experimentation + Production**: Extension for exploration, CLI for automation
✅ **Team Development**: Extension for code review, CLI for deployment

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. Extension: "Analyze codebase for refactoring opportunities"
2. Extension: Review proposed plan visually
3. CLI: claude --resume  (switch to CLI)
4. CLI: Rapid iteration on implementation
5. Extension: Resume for final visual diff review
6. Extension: Approve changes
```

### 10.2 Strategic Recommendations

**For Anthropic**:
1. Prioritize extension tab completion (high user demand)
2. Add conversation export to both interfaces
3. Bring slash command parity to extension
4. Improve CLI visual output for plan mode

**For Users**:
1. Start with extension for learning
2. Graduate to CLI for speed once comfortable
3. Use hybrid workflows for best of both
4. Set up MCP servers in CLI, use everywhere

**For Teams**:
1. Standardize on extension for code review
2. Use CLI for CI/CD automation
3. Document hybrid workflows in team wiki
4. Share MCP configurations via project scope

---

### 10.3 Future Outlook

**Expected Parity Improvements**:
- Checkpoints (both)
- Better slash command support (extension)
- Improved plan mode UX (CLI)
- JetBrains support (new surface)

**Likely Divergence**:
- Extension will remain superior for visual workflows
- CLI will remain superior for automation
- Both will retain unique strengths

**Net Assessment**: Complementary tools, not competitors. Choose based on task, not preference.
