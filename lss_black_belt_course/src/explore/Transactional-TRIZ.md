# Transactional TRIZ

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Adapt TRIZ methods to service and process design by resolving operational contradictions.

## Learning Objectives
- Map business process contradictions.  
- Apply inventive principles to service workflows.  
- Generate process improvement concepts with TRIZ tools.

## Overview
Transactional TRIZ extends TRIZ to non-physical systems such as business processes, focusing on resolving contradictions in process parameters (e.g., speed vs. accuracy).

## Key Steps
1. **Process Mapping:** Document current workflow steps.  
2. **Identify Contradictions:** Highlight conflicting objectives (e.g., faster process vs. fewer errors).  
3. **Select TRIZ Principles:** Match contradictions to inventive principles.  
4. **Concept Generation:** Brainstorm process modifications guided by principles.

## Example
Contradiction: Need to expedite customer support resolution time without increasing support staff.  
Apply Principle 10 (Preliminary Action): Create AI chatbots to handle Tier-0 queries before human intervention.

## Exercise
1. Select a business process and map contradictions.  
2. Choose 2 TRIZ principles to address a top contradiction.  
3. Design a revised process flow incorporating the principle.

## Summary
Transactional TRIZ brings inventive problem-solving to workflows, enabling breakthrough improvements in service and process design.
