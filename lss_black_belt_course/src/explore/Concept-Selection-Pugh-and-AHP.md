# Concept Selection – Pugh and AHP

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Evaluate and rank design concepts using Pugh matrix and Analytic Hierarchy Process.

## Learning Objectives
- Use Pugh matrix for qualitative concept comparison.  
- Apply AHP for quantitative weighting and scoring.  
- Select optimal concepts based on multi-criteria analysis.

## Overview
Concept selection balances multiple criteria against design options. The Pugh matrix offers a simple comparison, while AHP provides a rigorous hierarchical weighting and pairwise scoring.

## Key Steps
1. **Define Criteria:** Derive evaluation criteria from customer needs and technical requirements.  
2. **Pugh Matrix:** Compare concepts against a baseline (+, 0, –).  
3. **AHP Model:** Structure criteria hierarchy, perform pairwise comparisons to compute weights.  
4. **Score Concepts:** Rate each concept against criteria and calculate weighted scores.

## Example
Criteria: Cost, Performance, Reliability, Ease of Use.  
Concepts A, B, C are compared.  
Pugh identifies that Concept B has most + signs.  
AHP calculates weights: Cost 30%, Performance 40%, Reliability 20%, Usability 10% → final ranking B > A > C.

## Exercise
1. Build a 3×4 Pugh matrix for sample concepts.  
2. Conduct AHP pairwise comparisons for 4 criteria.  
3. Determine the top concept based on weighted scores.

## Summary
Combining Pugh and AHP ensures both qualitative and quantitative robustness in concept selection, aligning decisions with strategic priorities.
