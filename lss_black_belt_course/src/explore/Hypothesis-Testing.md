# Hypothesis Testing

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Perform statistical hypothesis testing for means, proportions, and variances.

## Learning Objectives
- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses.  
- Conduct t-tests, z-tests, and chi-square tests.  
- Interpret p-values and confidence intervals to make decisions.

## Overview
Hypothesis testing evaluates whether data provides sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative, using test statistics and significance levels.

## Key Steps
1. **Define Hypotheses:** State H0 and H1 clearly.  
2. **Select Test:** Choose t-test (small sample), z-test (large sample), or chi-square (categorical).  
3. **Calculate Statistic:** Compute test statistic and degrees of freedom.  
4. **Determine p-value:** Compare to significance level (α).  
5. **Conclusion:** Reject or fail to reject H0.

## Example
Test if average cycle time differs from 10 days (H0: μ = 10). Suppose n=15, sample mean=9.2, σ=1.0, α=0.05 → t-stat = (9.2–10)/(1/√15) = –3.1, p<0.01 → reject H0.

## Exercise
1. Given sample data, conduct a two-sample t-test for mean comparison.  
2. Perform a chi-square test for independence on categorical data.  
3. Interpret results in the context of business decisions.

## Summary
Hypothesis tests provide a rigorous framework for data-driven decision-making, enabling validation of assumptions with quantifiable confidence.
