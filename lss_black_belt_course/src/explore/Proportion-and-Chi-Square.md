# Proportion and Chi-Square Tests

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Use chi-square tests to analyze categorical data and proportions.

## Learning Objectives
- Prepare contingency tables for categorical data.  
- Conduct chi-square tests for goodness-of-fit and independence.  
- Interpret test results in business contexts.

## Overview
Chi-square tests evaluate whether observed categorical distributions differ from expected distributions (goodness-of-fit) or whether two categorical variables are independent (test of independence).

## Key Steps
1. **Create Table:** Build observed vs. expected counts.  
2. **Calculate Statistic:** χ² = Σ[(O–E)²/E].  
3. **Determine df:** (rows–1)×(columns–1) for independence.  
4. **Find p-value:** Compare statistic to χ² distribution.  
5. **Conclusion:** Reject H0 if p < α.

## Example
Test if sales distribution across 4 regions matches expected market share. Build observed vs. expected table and compute χ².

## Exercise
1. Given a 3×2 contingency table, perform chi-square test of independence.  
2. Report χ², df, p-value, and business implication.

## Summary
Chi-square tests provide a robust framework for analyzing categorical data, guiding strategic decisions based on customer segments, quality defects, and more.
