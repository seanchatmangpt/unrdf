# Statistical Tolerance Design

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Establish tolerances that balance quality and cost using statistical methods.

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate tolerance intervals for critical parameters.  
- Use statistical models to predict assembly variability.  
- Allocate tolerances to components to achieve final assembly requirements.

## Overview
Statistical tolerance design allocates permissible variation at component level to meet overall product specifications while minimizing cost. Techniques include tolerance stack-up analysis and Monte Carlo simulation.

## Key Steps
1. **Define Assembly Specs:** Set final product tolerances (e.g., ±0.05 mm).  
2. **List Components:** Identify dimensions and their worst-case tolerances.  
3. **Tolerance Stack-Up:** Calculate cumulative variation using RSS or worst-case methods.  
4. **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Simulate assembly build variations and assess yield.  
5. **Optimize Tolerances:** Adjust component tolerances to control yield and cost.

## Example
Assembly requires center-to-center distance = 50±0.1 mm. Components A, B, C tolerances chosen to ensure 99% assembly yield.

## Exercise
1. Given 3 component tolerances, perform RSS stack-up.  
2. Run a simple Monte Carlo simulation (Excel/Script) for 10,000 samples.  
3. Recommend tolerance adjustments to meet 95% yield.

## Summary
Statistical tolerance design ensures product build consistency and cost effectiveness by systematically allocating component tolerances.
