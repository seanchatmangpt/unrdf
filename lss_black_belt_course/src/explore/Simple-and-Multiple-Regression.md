# Simple and Multiple Regression

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Build and interpret regression models to predict outcomes and quantify factor effects.

## Learning Objectives
- Fit simple linear regression models.  
- Extend to multiple regression with several predictors.  
- Evaluate model fit (R², adjusted R²) and assumptions.

## Overview
Regression analysis models the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Simple regression uses one predictor; multiple regression uses many, helping identify key drivers.

## Key Steps
1. **Plot Data:** Scatterplots to inspect relationships.  
2. **Fit Model:** Compute regression coefficients via least squares.  
3. **Validate Assumptions:** Check residuals for normality, homoscedasticity, and independence.  
4. **Evaluate Fit:** Use R², adjusted R², and p-values.  
5. **Make Predictions:** Apply model to new data.

## Example
Model cycle time vs. batch size: simple regression yields y = 5 + 0.2x, R²=0.85. Multiple regression adds operator experience as predictor.

## Exercise
1. Fit a simple regression model on sample data.  
2. Extend to multiple regression adding two factors.  
3. Interpret coefficients and model diagnostics.

## Summary
Regression analysis provides quantitative insight into factor effects and enables predictive modeling for process optimization.
