# Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Systematically identify potential design failures, assess risks, and plan mitigations.

## Learning Objectives
- List potential failure modes for a design.  
- Rate Severity, Occurrence, and Detection (S, O, D).  
- Compute Risk Priority Number (RPN) and develop action plans.

## Overview
Design FMEA evaluates where and how a design might fail, the effects of failure, and prioritizes risks using the Risk Priority Number: RPN = S × O × D.

## Key Steps
1. **Function Analysis:** Break design into functions and components.  
2. **Identify Failure Modes:** Determine how each component can fail.  
3. **Assign Ratings:** Rate S (1–10), O (1–10), D (1–10) for each mode.  
4. **Calculate RPN:** Multiply S×O×D.  
5. **Prioritize & Act:** Focus on highest RPN items; define mitigation actions.

## Example
Component: Hydraulic valve. Failure mode: Seal leak. S=8, O=3, D=4 → RPN=96. Mitigation: improve material and add detection sensor.

## Exercise
1. Conduct a mini-FMEA for three components of a product.  
2. Identify top-2 risks and propose mitigation plans.

## Summary
Design FMEA proactively uncovers potential failures, enabling risk-informed design decisions and enhanced reliability.
