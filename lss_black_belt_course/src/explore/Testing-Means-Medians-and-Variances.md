# Testing Means, Medians, and Variances

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Compare groups using parametric and nonparametric tests for means, medians, and variances.

## Learning Objectives
- Conduct t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests.  
- Perform F-tests to compare variances.  
- Choose appropriate tests based on data distribution.

## Overview
Parametric tests assume normality (t-tests for means, F-tests for variances). Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Levene’s test) are used when assumptions are violated.

## Key Steps
1. **Assess Normality:** Use histograms or Shapiro-Wilk test.  
2. **Select Test:** t-test for means, Mann-Whitney for medians, F-test/Levene for variances.  
3. **Compute Test Statistic:** Apply formulas.  
4. **Interpret Results:** Evaluate p-values against α.

## Example
Compare two production lines: line A (n=20), line B (n=20). Data non-normal → use Mann-Whitney test to compare medians.

## Exercise
1. Analyze sample dataset for normality.  
2. Choose and run appropriate tests for mean/median/variance comparison.  
3. Summarize findings and recommendations.

## Summary
Selecting correct tests for central tendency and dispersion ensures valid group comparisons and reliable conclusions.
