# Concept Generation

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Generate a broad and diverse set of creative solutions using structured ideation methods.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply brainstorming and brainwriting techniques.  
- Use morphological analysis to explore feature combinations.  
- Employ mind mapping to connect ideas hierarchically.

## Overview
Concept generation seeks to expand potential solutions beyond obvious ideas. Structured methods ensure comprehensive exploration and foster innovation.

## Key Steps
1. **Brainstorming:** Facilitate open, no-judgment idea sessions.  
2. **Brainwriting:** Individuals write ideas independently before group sharing.  
3. **Morphological Analysis:** Create a matrix of parameters and mix-and-match variants.  
4. **Mind Mapping:** Visualize relationships between concepts and sub-ideas.  
5. **Documentation:** Record all concepts for subsequent evaluation.

## Example
For a new delivery drone design:
- Brainstorm flight energy sources: battery, solar, hybrid.  
- Morphological axes: payload capacity, range, speed, control interface.  
- Combine values to generate 20+ candidate concepts.

## Exercise
1. Select a product/process and apply morphological analysis with 3 parameters.  
2. Conduct a 10-minute brainwriting session and share top 5 ideas.  
3. Create a mind map of your favorite concept.

## Summary
Structured ideation methods ensure diverse, high-potential concept generation, paving the way for effective concept selection and development.
