# TRIZ for New Product Design

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Use TRIZ principles to systematically overcome contradictions and innovate design solutions.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the 40 TRIZ inventive principles.  
- Identify technical contradictions in designs.  
- Apply TRIZ to generate innovation-focused concepts.

## Overview
TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is a methodology based on patterns of invention identified in global patents. It resolves contradictions by applying 40 inventive principles and other TRIZ tools.

## Key Steps
1. **Identify Contradictions:** Determine conflicting parameters (e.g., strength vs. weight).  
2. **Select Inventive Principles:** Choose relevant TRIZ principles to resolve contradictions.  
3. **Apply Principles:** Brainstorm design modifications guided by selected principles.  
4. **Refine Concepts:** Evaluate feasibility and iterate.

## Example
Contradiction: Increase battery life (parameter A) without increasing weight (parameter B).  
Apply TRIZ Principle 35 (Parameter Change): Use energy harvesting from solar cells integrated into airframe.

## Exercise
1. List two product contradictions.  
2. For each, select 3 TRIZ principles and propose concept modifications.  
3. Share and evaluate top concept with peer group.

## Summary
TRIZ provides a structured framework to resolve design contradictions and unlock innovative solutions beyond incremental brainstorming.
