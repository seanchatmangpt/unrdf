# Multi-Vari Analysis

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Use multi-vari charts to visualize variation across factors and identify dominant sources.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand nested variance and interaction effects.  
- Create multi-vari charts in Minitab or Excel.  
- Interpret chart patterns to pinpoint variation drivers.

## Overview
Multi-vari analysis displays data variation by factors (e.g., between groups, within groups, over time), helping teams quickly identify where most variation occurs.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Structuring:** Organize data with columns for categorical factors and measured value.  
2. **Chart Selection:** Choose between types: between operator, within part, over time.  
3. **Plot Chart:** Generate multi-vari chart showing nested lines for each factor.  
4. **Interpret:** Identify where lines diverge most to guide focus.

## Example
Analyze variation by shift (A, B, C) and machine location. Chart reveals shift-to-shift variation dominates.

## Exercise
1. Using sample dataset, build a multi-vari chart.  
2. Document which factor contributes >50% of total variation.

## Summary
Multi-vari charts visually break down variation by factor, enabling rapid identification of key improvement areas without complex stats.
