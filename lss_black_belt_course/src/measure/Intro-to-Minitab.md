# Introduction to Minitab

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Learn Minitab basics for data analysis and visualization in process improvement projects.

## Learning Objectives
- Navigate the Minitab interface and worksheet.  
- Perform basic statistical analyses (descriptive stats, control charts).  
- Export graphs and results for reporting.

## Overview
Minitab is a statistical software package tailored for Six Sigma and quality improvement projects. It provides tools for descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, control charts, regression, DOE, and more—all within a user-friendly interface.

## Key Steps
1. **Opening Data:** Import Excel or CSV into Minitab worksheet.  
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Use Stat → Basic Statistics → Display Descriptive Statistics.  
3. **Control Charts:** Stat → Control Charts → choose X̄-R, p-Chart, etc.  
4. **Hypothesis Tests:** Stat → Basic Statistics → T-Test or Chi-Square.  
5. **Graphs:** Graph → Histogram, Boxplot, Scatterplot.  
6. **DOE:** Stat → DOE → Full Factorial.

## Example Walkthrough
1. Load the `SampleData.csv`.  
2. Compute mean, median, and standard deviation for the `Time` column.  
3. Create an X̄-R chart for `Batch` data.  
4. Perform a two-sample t-test comparing two groups.

## Exercise
1. Import `VOC.csv` and generate descriptive statistics.  
2. Create a p-chart for defect data.  
3. Save and export one graph to PNG.

## Summary
Minitab accelerates statistical analysis with built-in workflows for Six Sigma methods, enabling teams to focus on insights rather than software mechanics.
