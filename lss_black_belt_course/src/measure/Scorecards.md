# Scorecards

**Duration:** 1 hour
**Objective:** Build a Balanced Scorecard to align and monitor key metrics across four perspectives.

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish the four Balanced Scorecard perspectives.  
- Select and weight KPIs for each domain.  
- Design a visual dashboard for real-time tracking.

## Overview
The Balanced Scorecard links long-term strategy to operational metrics under:
1. **Financial**  
2. **Customer**  
3. **Internal Processes**  
4. **Learning & Growth**
By tracking KPIs in each area, organizations maintain strategic balance and prevent sub-optimization.

## Key Steps
1. **Define Objectives:** Clarify what success looks like in each perspective.  
2. **Identify KPIs:** Choose measurable indicators (e.g., ROI, NPS, cycle time, training hours).  
3. **Set Targets:** Establish baseline and stretch goals.  
4. **Select Data Sources:** Determine how and when each KPI is measured.  
5. **Dashboard Creation:** Use charts, gauges, and color codes to display performance.

## Example Dashboard
| Perspective       | KPI                     | Baseline | Target |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Financial         | Cost per Unit ($)       | 5.00     | 4.00    |
| Customer          | Net Promoter Score      | 50       | 70      |
| Internal Process  | Defect Rate (%)         | 3.0      | 1.0     |
| Learning & Growth | Training Hours/FTE      | 10       | 20      |

## Exercise
1. Identify 2â€“3 KPIs for each quadrant in your organization.  
2. Sketch a mock scorecard slide highlighting current vs. target values.

## Summary
Balanced Scorecards provide a holistic view of organizational health, ensuring that financial outcomes, customer satisfaction, process excellence, and capability building move in sync.
