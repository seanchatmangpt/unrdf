# Understanding Variation and Control Charts

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Differentiate common‐cause from special‐cause variation and apply control charts to ensure process stability.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify sources of common‐cause and special‐cause variation.  
- Select and construct appropriate control charts (X̄-R, p-chart, c-chart).  
- Interpret chart patterns to drive corrective actions.

## Overview
Variation is inherent in all processes and can be categorized into:
- **Common‐cause** variation: Random, stable fluctuations.  
- **Special‐cause** variation: Assignable events causing outliers or trends.
Control charts plot process data over time with statistically derived control limits (e.g., ±3σ), enabling detection of abnormal patterns.

## Control Chart Types
| Chart Key | Data Type   | Subgroup Size | Use Case                          |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| X̄-R      | Continuous  | n ≤ 10        | Monitor mean and range per subgroup |
| X̄-S      | Continuous  | n > 10        | Monitor mean and standard deviation |
| p-chart   | Proportion  | Variable      | Proportion defective               |
| c-chart   | Count       | Constant      | Count of defects per unit          |

## Key Steps
1. **Collect Data:** Ensure consistent sampling intervals and subgroup sizes.  
2. **Calculate Metrics:** Compute subgroup statistics (mean, range, p, c).  
3. **Compute Limits:** Apply statistical factors (e.g., A2, D3, D4) to set UCL and LCL.  
4. **Plot Chart:** Graph points with control limits and center line.  
5. **Analyze Signals:** Use Western Electric or Nelson rules to detect special‐cause patterns.

## Example
Generate an X̄-R chart for 20 production batches (n=5). Identify points outside control limits and investigate root causes for any outliers.

## Exercise
1. Create a p-chart for daily defect proportions.  
2. Identify any special‐cause signals and categorize them.  
3. Propose corrective actions to eliminate the special causes.

## Summary
Control charts are foundational for ongoing process monitoring. Correct interpretation distinguishes random from assignable variation, guiding effective interventions.
