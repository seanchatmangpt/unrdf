# Basic Statistics

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Master key statistical measures and distributions needed for Six Sigma analysis.

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.  
- Understand normal, Poisson, and binomial distributions.  
- Apply descriptive statistics in data summaries.

## Overview
Basic statistics provide the foundation for data-driven decision-making. Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) describe data location, while dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation) quantifies variability.
Many Six Sigma tools assume normal distribution; understanding distribution shapes and parameters is critical.

## Key Concepts
1. **Mean & Median:** The average and middle value of a dataset.  
2. **Mode:** Most frequent value.  
3. **Variance & Standard Deviation:** Spread of data around the mean.  
4. **Distributions:** Normal (continuous, bell curve), Poisson (counts), Binomial (success/failure).

## Example Calculations
Given data: [5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- Mean = 7.8
- Median = 8
- Std Dev â‰ˆ 1.85

## Exercise
1. Compute mean, median, and standard deviation for your project data.  
2. Plot the data histogram and overlay a normal curve.  
3. Identify if data is skewed and suggest transformation.

## Summary
Understanding basic statistical measures and distributions is essential for interpreting data and selecting appropriate improvement tools.
