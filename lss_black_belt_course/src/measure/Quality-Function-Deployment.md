# Quality Function Deployment (QFD)

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Translate customer needs into detailed technical requirements using the House of Quality.

## Learning Objectives
- Construct a House of Quality matrix mapping ‘Whats’ to ‘Hows’.  
- Quantify relationships and perform competitive benchmarking.  
- Prioritize technical efforts based on weighted importance.

## Overview
Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a visual tool that captures customer requirements (‘Whats’) and links them to design characteristics (‘Hows’) via a matrix called the House of Quality. This helps ensure engineering decisions align with customer priorities and market competition.

## Key Steps
1. **Identify ‘Whats’:** List customer requirements from VOC data.  
2. **Define ‘Hows’:** Determine technical features/processes that address each What.  
3. **Relationship Matrix:** Rate each What-How pair (e.g., 9 = strong relationship to 1 = weak).  
4. **Correlation Roof:** Map interactions among Hows, highlighting synergies and trade-offs.  
5. **Competitive Benchmarking:** Score competitors on each What and set target values.  
6. **Prioritization:** Compute weighted scores to identify top-priority Hows.

## Example
| What (Customer Need)     | Importance | How: Response Time | How: Reliability | How: Export Capability |
|--------------------------|------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Fast page load          | 5          | 9                  | 1                | 1                      |
| Stable uptime           | 4          | 1                  | 9                | 1                      |
| Easy data export        | 3          | 1                  | 1                | 9                      |

Weighted sum for Response Time = 5×9 + 4×1 + 3×1 = 50

## Exercise
1. Create a mini-HoQ for three customer needs and three technical responses.  
2. Benchmark two competitor products and annotate target values.  
3. Identify the top two Hows to focus development resources.

## Summary
QFD ensures a customer-centric design process by linking voice-of-customer directly to technical requirements. The House of Quality matrix helps visualize priorities and competitive positioning.
