# Voice of the Customer

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Learn how to capture, analyze, and translate customer needs into design requirements.

## Learning Objectives
- Conduct interviews and surveys to gather VOC data.
- Organize feedback using affinity diagrams.
- Apply Kano Analysis to prioritize features.

## Overview
Voice of the Customer (VOC) is the process of capturing customer expectations and translating them into design inputs. Common data sources include interviews, focus groups, surveys, complaint logs, and social media feedback.
Accurate VOC ensures that design efforts focus on features that deliver the most customer value and avoid investing in unwanted functions.

## Key Steps
1. **Planning:** Define objectives, identify target customer segments, and choose data collection methods.
2. **Data Collection:** Conduct interviews (structured/unstructured) and deploy surveys with rating scales and open-ended questions.
3. **Affinity Diagramming:** Cluster similar feedback into common themes using post-it notes or digital tools.
4. **Kano Analysis:** Classify needs into Must-Be, One-Dimensional, Attractive, Indifferent, or Reverse categories.
5. **Requirement Translation:** Convert clusters into SMART requirements, specifying metrics and target values.

## Example
- Customers report slow system response times (Must-Be requirement).
- Users desire an export-to-Excel feature (One-Dimensional requirement).
- Advanced analytics “wow” features (Attractive requirement).

Translate to requirement: “System shall load dashboard metrics within 3 seconds for 95% of users.”

## Exercise
1. Draft 5 interview questions to uncover performance and usability needs.
2. Given sample responses, create an affinity diagram with at least 3 clusters.
3. Perform a mini-Kano analysis on 4 proposed features.

## Summary
VOC is essential for understanding real customer pain points. Using affinity diagrams and Kano models helps prioritize high-value features and avoid wasted effort.
