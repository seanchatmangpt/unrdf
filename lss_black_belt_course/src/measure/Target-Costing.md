# Target Costing

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Calculate product cost targets driven by customer price expectations and profit requirements.

## Learning Objectives
- Derive target cost from market price and profit margin.  
- Break down allowable cost allocation across components.  
- Use cost drivers to identify design trade-offs.

## Overview
Target costing starts with an anticipated market price and desired profit margin, subtracting profit to establish the maximum allowable cost. The product and process design must then meet this cost target by leveraging design-to-cost strategies.

## Key Steps
1. **Market Analysis:** Research competitive pricing and total cost of ownership.  
2. **Set Profit Margin:** Define target profit percentage.  
3. **Calculate Target Cost:** Market Price – (Market Price × Profit Margin).  
4. **Cost Breakdown:** Allocate cost targets to major cost elements (materials, labor, overhead).  
5. **Cost Driver Analysis:** Identify key drivers and adjust design to meet targets.

## Example
- Market price = $100; desired profit margin = 20%  
- Target Cost = $100 – ($100×0.20) = $80  
- Allocate: Materials $50, Labor $20, Overhead $10

## Exercise
1. Given a market price of $200 and profit of 25%, calculate the target cost.  
2. Propose a cost allocation across 4 components.  
3. Identify two design changes to reduce material cost by 10%.

## Summary
Target costing ensures product designs meet customer price expectations and profitability goals by tightly coupling market input with design decisions.
