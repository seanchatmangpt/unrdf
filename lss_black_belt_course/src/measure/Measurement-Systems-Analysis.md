# Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Evaluate and improve the reliability of measurement processes through Gage R&R studies.

## Learning Objectives
- Define accuracy, precision, repeatability, and reproducibility.  
- Conduct Gage R&R studies using ANOVA and average-and-range methods.  
- Interpret results and identify measurement system improvements.

## Overview
MSA ensures that measurement systems produce trustworthy data. Key concepts include:
- **Accuracy:** Closeness to true value.  
- **Precision:** Consistency of repeated measurements.  
- **Repeatability:** Variation when same operator measures same part.  
- **Reproducibility:** Variation between different operators.

## Key Steps
1. **Plan Study:** Select parts, operators, and measurement trials (e.g., 10 parts × 3 operators × 2 trials).  
2. **Collect Data:** Record measurements under controlled conditions.  
3. **Analyze:** Use ANOVA or average-and-range methods to calculate % of tolerance attributed to measurement error.  
4. **Interpret:** %GRR < 10% is acceptable; 10–30% requires improvement; >30% unacceptable.  
5. **Improve:** Calibrate instruments, train operators, tighten procedures.

## Example
10 parts measured twice by 3 operators. ANOVA shows measurement variation = 5% of total variation (acceptable). Implement training to reduce operator variation.

## Exercise
1. Design a Gage R&R study for a critical dimension.  
2. Use Minitab (or Excel) to analyze your collected data.  
3. Propose corrective actions if %GRR > 10%.

## Summary
Reliable measurement systems are crucial; MSA identifies sources of error and guides improvements to ensure data quality.
