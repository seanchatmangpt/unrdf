# Prototype and Pilot

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Develop prototypes and pilot tests to validate solutions under real-world conditions.

## Learning Objectives
- Build functional prototypes or pilot processes.  
- Collect and analyze pilot data.  
- Refine solution based on pilot feedback.

## Overview
Prototyping and pilot testing verify design feasibility. Prototypes can be physical models or MVP software; pilots test solutions in controlled production environments.

## Key Steps
1. **Prototype Development:** Create low- or high-fidelity prototypes.  
2. **Pilot Planning:** Define pilot scope, participants, and metrics.  
3. **Execution:** Run prototype/pilot, collect performance and feedback data.  
4. **Analysis:** Compare pilot results to targets, identify issues.  
5. **Iteration:** Incorporate findings into design refinements.

## Example
Pilot new assembly station for smartphone enclosures with trained operators, measure cycle time and defect rate over 100 units.

## Exercise
1. Draft a pilot test plan with objectives and success criteria.  
2. Simulate pilot data collection and analyze results.

## Summary
Prototyping and pilot phases validate design assumptions, uncover unforeseen challenges, and guide final refinements.
