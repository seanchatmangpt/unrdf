# Process Control

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Establish control plans and monitoring mechanisms to sustain process improvements.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop control plans for key process steps.  
- Implement SPC charts and control limits.  
- Define roles and responsibilities for control.

## Overview
Process control ensures improvements are maintained post-implementation. Control plans document monitoring methods, reaction plans, and ownership for each critical parameter.

## Key Steps
1. **Identify Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) Parameters:** Determine key metrics to monitor.  
2. **Select Control Methods:** Choose SPC charts or other indicators.  
3. **Establish Control Limits:** Based on baseline data or spec limits.  
4. **Documentation:** Create control plan with sample frequency, responsible parties, and reaction protocols.  
5. **Training:** Educate operators and engineers on control procedures.

## Example
Control plan for injection molding: monitor cavity pressure and part dimensions using XÌ„-R charts, with alerts set for out-of-limit conditions.

## Exercise
1. Draft a control plan for one critical process step in your project.  
2. Define SPC chart type, sample frequency, and reaction plan.

## Summary
Robust process control embeds monitoring into daily operations, ensuring sustained quality and early detection of deviations.
