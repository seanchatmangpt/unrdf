# Implementation Planning

**Duration:** 1 hour
**Objective:** Develop detailed plans for full-scale rollout, training, and handoff to operations.

## Learning Objectives
- Create a detailed implementation roadmap.  
- Develop training materials and SOPs.  
- Plan change management and handoff activities.

## Overview
Implementation planning prepares teams for successful deployment of improvements. It includes rollout sequencing, training, documentation, and governance handover.

## Key Steps
1. **Define Rollout Phases:** Pilot, phased rollouts, full-scale.  
2. **Resource Planning:** Assign roles, schedule training, allocate budgets.  
3. **Develop Materials:** Create SOPs, job aids, e-learning modules.  
4. **Communication & Change Mgmt:** Announce changes, support feedback.  
5. **Handoff:** Transfer ownership to process owners and support teams.

## Example
Rollout plan for new KPI dashboard: pilot with 2 sites, train 10 power users, then scale to all locations over 4 weeks.

## Exercise
1. Draft an outline for an SOP covering new process steps.  
2. Create a training schedule and list of stakeholders for communication.

## Summary
Thorough implementation planning ensures that gains from DMEDI phases are institutionalized and sustained in daily operations.
