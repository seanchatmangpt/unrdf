# Helicopter Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Simulation

**Duration:** 1 hour
**Objective:** Explore response surface modeling through an interactive helicopter simulation.

## Learning Objectives
- Visualize quadratic effects and optimum factor levels.  
- Interpret contour and 3D surface plots.  
- Optimize performance metrics in simulation.

## Overview
The Helicopter RSM Simulation provides a virtual experiment to model response surfaces, demonstrating curvature effects and optimization in a dynamic scenario.

## Key Steps
1. **Launch Simulation:** Open the Helicopter RSM tool.  
2. **Define Factors:** Set parameters (e.g., rotor speed, blade pitch).  
3. **Design Runs:** Execute a CCD or Box-Behnken design in the simulator.  
4. **Fit Surface Model:** Use built-in analysis to generate polynomial model.  
5. **Explore Surface:** Investigate contours and locate optimum settings.

## Example
Adjust rotor speed and pitch to maximize hover stability, visualizing the optimal region on a response surface.

## Exercise
1. Perform a Box-Behnken design with three factors.  
2. Identify the factor combination yielding peak stability.

## Summary
RSM simulation solidifies understanding of curvature modeling and the power of surface plots in identifying optimal design settings.
