# Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA)

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Simplify product design to minimize manufacturing and assembly costs and time.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply DFMA guidelines to reduce part count.  
- Use assembly process analysis to streamline operations.  
- Evaluate designs for ease of manufacture.

## Overview
DFMA combines DFM (ease of manufacturing) and DFA (ease of assembly) principles to optimize product designs for lower cost and higher quality.

## Key Steps
1. **Part Count Reduction:** Evaluate each part for necessity and function.  
2. **Standardization:** Use common parts, modules, and materials.  
3. **Assembly Sequence Analysis:** Design for minimal handling and alignment.  
4. **Design Guidelines:** Minimize fasteners, use snap-fits, enable self-locating features.  
5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Compare manufacturing vs. assembly trade-offs.

## Example
Redesign gearbox cover with integrated clips instead of screws, reducing assembly time by 30%.

## Exercise
1. Identify 3 components in a sample product that can be combined or eliminated.  
2. Propose a redesign with simplified assembly steps.

## Summary
DFMA drives cost reduction and quality improvement by embedding manufacturing and assembly considerations early in the design process.
