# Robust Design

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Design products and processes to be insensitive to variability and noise factors.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Taguchi methods for robust parameter design.  
- Use orthogonal arrays to study noise and control factors.  
- Analyze main and interaction effects for robustness.

## Overview
Robust design (Taguchi) uses controlled experiments to identify factor settings that minimize variability in the presence of noise factors, improving consistency without costly tolerance tightening.

## Key Steps
1. **Identify Control & Noise Factors:** List parameters you can and cannot control.  
2. **Select Orthogonal Array:** Match factors and levels to an L-array.  
3. **Conduct Experiments:** Vary control and noise factors per array.  
4. **Compute SN Ratios:** Signal-to-noise ratios for performance metrics.  
5. **Optimize:** Choose factor levels that maximize SN ratio.

## Example
Use L9 orthogonal array to test 3 control factors and 2 noise factors, analyzing SN ratios for S/N = larger-is-better metric.

## Exercise
1. Identify one product feature and two noise factors.  
2. Select an appropriate Taguchi array and plan runs.  
3. Calculate SN ratios for sample data and recommend settings.

## Summary
Robust design ensures product performance remains consistent despite uncontrollable variability, reducing warranty costs and customer complaints.
