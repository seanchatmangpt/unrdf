# Conjoint Analysis

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Apply conjoint analysis to determine customer preference trade-offs.

## Learning Objectives
- Design conjoint survey experiments.  
- Analyze part-worth utilities.  
- Interpret results for feature prioritization.

## Overview
Conjoint analysis deconstructs customer preferences by presenting combinations of features and measuring choices. Statistical analysis yields part-worth utilities and relative importance of attributes.

## Key Steps
1. **Select Attributes & Levels:** Identify key features and realistic levels.  
2. **Design Surveys:** Use orthogonal or efficient designs to limit profiles.  
3. **Collect Responses:** Gather preferences or ratings.  
4. **Estimate Utilities:** Analyze data (e.g., regressions) to calculate part-worths.  
5. **Simulate Market:** Predict market share for new product concepts.

## Example
Attributes: Price ($50/$75/$100), Battery life (2h/4h/6h). Estimate utilities and simulate preference share for each combination.

## Exercise
1. Draft a conjoint survey with 3 attributes at 2 levels each.  
2. Analyze provided sample data to compute part-worths.  
3. Recommend the optimal feature mix.

## Summary
Conjoint analysis provides quantitative insight into customer trade-offs, guiding product feature and pricing decisions.
