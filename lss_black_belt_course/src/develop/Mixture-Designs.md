# Mixture Designs

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Use mixture designs to optimize proportions of components in a formulation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand simplex-lattice and simplex-centroid designs.  
- Model responses as functions of component proportions.  
- Interpret mixture model coefficients.

## Overview
Mixture designs apply when factors are proportions summing to 100% (e.g., chemical formulations). Response surface models are tailored to mixture constraints.

## Key Steps
1. **Identify Components:** List ingredients and ranges (e.g., 20â€“50%).  
2. **Select Design:** Choose simplex-lattice or centroid design based on number of components.  
3. **Run Experiments:** Prepare formulations and measure responses.  
4. **Fit Model:** Use special polynomial models for mixtures.  
5. **Optimize Blend:** Identify proportions that maximize target response.

## Example
Three-component paint mixture optimized for gloss, durability, and cost using simplex-lattice design.

## Exercise
1. Define a 3-component mixture design.  
2. Analyze sample data to fit a mixture model.  
3. Determine optimal component ratios.

## Summary
Mixture designs enable rigorous optimization of component proportions in formulations, accounting for blending constraints.
