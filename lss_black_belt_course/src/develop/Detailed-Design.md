# Detailed Design

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Translate selected concepts into detailed technical specifications and design artifacts.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop detailed drawings or process flow diagrams.  
- Define materials, tolerances, and interfaces.  
- Create BOMs and data sheets.

## Overview
Detailed design finalizes the product or process specifications before prototyping. It encompasses CAD drawings, process documentation, and part specifications to ensure manufacturability and quality.

## Key Steps
1. **Select Concepts:** Finalize concept(s) to develop.  
2. **Technical Drawings:** Create CAD or process flow diagrams with full annotations.  
3. **Specification Sheets:** Document materials, dimensions, tolerances, and standards.  
4. **BOM Development:** List all parts, quantities, and suppliers.  
5. **Review & Approval:** Conduct design reviews with cross-functional team.

## Example
Produce detailed CAD drawings for a housing assembly including fastener details, surface finish, and material callouts.

## Exercise
1. Draft a simplified process flow diagram for a chosen concept.  
2. Create a parts list with materials and preliminary cost estimates.

## Summary
Detailed design bridges concept and prototyping by solidifying all technical details and ensuring readiness for development or pilot runs.
