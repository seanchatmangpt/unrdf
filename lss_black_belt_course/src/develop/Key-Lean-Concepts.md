# Key Lean Concepts

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Understand foundational lean principles for waste elimination and flow optimization.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify the eight wastes (TIMWOOD+1).  
- Apply value-stream mapping to visualize processes.  
- Use pull systems and standardized work to maintain flow.

## Overview
Lean focuses on maximizing customer value by minimizing waste. Core concepts include:
- **TIMWOOD:** Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects, Skills (underutilization).  
- **Value-Stream Mapping:** Visual tool to map material and information flow.  
- **Pull Systems:** Produce only what downstream process needs.  
- **5S & Standard Work:** Organize workspace and define consistent methods.

## Key Steps
1. **Map Current State:** Create a value-stream map with flows and lead times.  
2. **Identify Waste:** Mark non-value-add activities.  
3. **Design Future State:** Propose lean improvements (pull, batch size reduction).  
4. **Implement 5S:** Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain.  
5. **Monitor Flow:** Use takt time and Kanban signals.

## Example
Value-stream map for order fulfillment, identifying bottlenecks in waiting and excess inventory.

## Exercise
1. Conduct a 5S audit of your workspace.  
2. Draft a current-state value-stream map for a simple process.

## Summary
Lean principles underpin efficient process design, focusing on waste reduction, flow, and continuous improvement.
