# Introduction to Design of Experiments (DOE)

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Learn fundamental DOE concepts for efficient experimentation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand factorial, fractional, and response surface designs.  
- Recognize principles of randomization, replication, and blocking.  
- Plan experiments to estimate main effects and interactions.

## Overview
DOE systematically varies factors to identify their effect on a response. Core principles include:
- **Randomization:** Mitigate uncontrolled variation.  
- **Replication:** Improve precision.  
- **Blocking:** Control known nuisance factors.

## Key Steps
1. **Define Factors & Levels:** Select variables and their settings.  
2. **Select Design:** Choose full- or fractional-factorial based on resource constraints.  
3. **Randomize Runs:** Random order to reduce bias.  
4. **Conduct Trials:** Collect response data.  
5. **Analyze Results:** Use ANOVA or regression to estimate effects.

## Example
Full 2Â³ factorial for three factors at two levels, requiring 8 runs to estimate all main effects and interactions.

## Exercise
1. Plan a DOE with 4 factors at two levels using a fractional design.  
2. Generate run order and explain randomization rationale.

## Summary
DOE empowers teams to discover significant factor effects efficiently, driving data-driven design improvements.
