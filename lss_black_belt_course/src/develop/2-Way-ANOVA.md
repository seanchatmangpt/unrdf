# 2-Way ANOVA

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Analyze the effects of two factors and their interaction on a response variable.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up a two-factor ANOVA table.  
- Test main effects and interaction significance.  
- Interpret F-statistics and p-values.

## Overview
Two-way ANOVA evaluates the impact of two categorical independent variables on a continuous dependent variable, identifying both individual (main) and combined (interaction) effects.

## Key Steps
1. **Design Experiment:** Choose levels for factors A and B and sample sizes.  
2. **Collect Data:** Measure response for all factor level combinations.  
3. **ANOVA Table:** Compute sum of squares for factor A, factor B, interaction, and error.  
4. **F-tests:** Calculate F ratios and p-values for each source.  
5. **Interpretation:** Determine significant factors and interactions.

## Example
Factors: Temperature (Low, High) and Pressure (Low, High); response: yield %. ANOVA shows significant interaction (p<0.01).

## Exercise
1. Perform two-way ANOVA on sample data with 2Ã—3 factor levels.  
2. Create interaction plots to visualize effects.  
3. Summarize findings on factor significance.

## Summary
Two-way ANOVA provides insight into how multiple factors and their interactions affect outcomes, guiding design optimization.
