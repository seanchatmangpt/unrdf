# Lean Design

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
**Objective:** Integrate lean principles into the design process to create efficient, waste-free solutions.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply lean thinking to product and process design.  
- Use design for flow and minimal inventory concepts.  
- Implement standard work in the design process.

## Overview
Lean design ensures that products and processes are created with minimal waste and maximum value. It emphasizes flow, pull, and error-proofing (poka-yoke) from the outset.

## Key Steps
1. **Define Value Streams:** Identify how material and information should flow.  
2. **Minimize Complexity:** Reduce part count and simplify assembly.  
3. **Poka-Yoke:** Incorporate error-proofing features.  
4. **Just-In-Time Design:** Align design activities with build schedule.  
5. **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen):** Iterate designs based on feedback.

## Example
Designing a modular electronics enclosure that snaps together without tools to reduce assembly time and defects.

## Exercise
1. Propose a poka-yoke feature for a given product scenario.  
2. List three design changes to simplify a product assembly process.

## Summary
Lean design embeds waste elimination and flow optimization at the concept stage, resulting in more efficient products and processes.
