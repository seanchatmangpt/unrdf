# DOE Catapult Simulation

**Duration:** 1 hour
**Objective:** Experiment interactively with DOE parameters using a simulation environment.

## Learning Objectives
- Explore factorial designs in a simulation tool.  
- Visualize effects of factor settings on outcomes.  
- Reinforce DOE concepts through hands-on experimentation.

## Overview
The DOE Catapult Simulation provides an interactive environment to test experimental designs without physical constraints. Users can adjust factor levels and see immediate results, reinforcing DOE principles.

## Key Steps
1. **Launch Simulator:** Open the DOE Catapult application.  
2. **Select Design Type:** Choose full or fractional factorial.  
3. **Set Factors:** Input factor names and levels.  
4. **Run Simulations:** Execute virtual experiments.  
5. **Analyze Outputs:** Review effect plots and ANOVA tables.

## Example
Simulate a 2^3 design for catapult launch distance with factors: Arm Length, Tension, Launch Angle.

## Exercise
1. Configure a half-fraction design in the simulation.  
2. Identify significant factors and interactions from simulator output.

## Summary
Simulation accelerates DOE learning by allowing rapid iteration and immediate visualization of design outcomes.
