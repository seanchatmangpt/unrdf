# Design of Experiments with Curvature (RSM)

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Objective:** Extend factorial designs to include curvature for response surface modeling.

## Learning Objectives
- Design experiments with center points and axial runs.  
- Fit second-order polynomial models.  
- Optimize responses using response surfaces.

## Overview
Response Surface Methodology (RSM) adds curvature detection to factorial DOE, allowing modeling of non-linear responses. Designs include Central Composite and Box-Behnken.

## Key Steps
1. **Add Center Points:** Include multiple center runs to detect curvature.  
2. **Axial Points:** Extend design along factor axes for quadratic modeling.  
3. **Fit Model:** Use regression to fit 2nd-order polynomial.  
4. **Contour & Surface Plots:** Visualize optimal factor settings.  
5. **Optimization:** Determine factor levels that maximize or minimize the response.

## Example
Central Composite Design for two factors with five-level settings yields contour plots identifying peak performance region.

## Exercise
1. Plan a CCD for two factors.  
2. Fit a second-order model and generate contour plots.  
3. Identify the optimal factor combination.

## Summary
Incorporating curvature detection enables fine-tuning of factor settings and maximizes response optimization beyond linear models.
