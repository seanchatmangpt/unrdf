# Mission, Goals, Plan & Performance (MGPP)

**Duration:** 1 hour
**Objective:** Define the strategic framework (Mission, Goals, Plan, Performance) to guide the project.

## Learning Objectives
- Define a project Mission aligned to organizational strategy.
- Establish SMART Goals with KPIs.
- Outline a high-level Plan with milestones and resources.
- Select Performance metrics and target values.

## Overview
MGPP captures four key elements:
- **Mission**: The why of the project.
- **Goals**: What will be achieved (measurable outcomes).
- **Plan**: How and when activities will be executed.
- **Performance**: How success is measured (metrics and targets).

## Key Steps
1. Draft a concise Mission statement.
2. Define SMART Goals and select KPIs.
3. Develop a timeline with key Plan milestones.
4. Specify Performance metrics, data sources, and review frequency.

## Example
> Mission: "Reduce order processing time by 50% within 6 months."
> Goals: "Average cycle time ≤5 days; On-time delivery ≥98%."
> Plan: Define (W1–2), Measure (W2–4), Explore (W4–6), Develop (W6–8), Implement (W8–12).
> Performance: Track cycle time and on-time rate weekly.

## Exercise
1. Create a Mission statement for a current process improvement.
2. List two SMART Goals with KPIs and targets.
3. Sketch a basic Plan timeline for DMEDI phases.

## Summary
MGPP unifies strategic intent, objectives, execution plan, and success metrics to drive project alignment and accountability.
