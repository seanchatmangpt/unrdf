# DMEDI Capstone Project

**Duration:** 4 hours (project kickoff) + ongoing
**Objective:** Apply the entire DMEDI methodology to a real-world challenge and present documented outcomes.

## Learning Objectives
- Execute all DMEDI phases on a selected project.  
- Integrate statistical and lean tools effectively.  
- Present results with data-driven recommendations.

## Overview
The capstone project synthesizes all course elements. Teams select a problem, charter the project, gather data, generate and evaluate concepts, design experiments, pilot solutions, and implement control plans.

## Project Phases
1. **Define:** Create charter, MGPP, risk and communication plans.  
2. **Measure:** Collect baseline data, perform MSA, capability, control charts.  
3. **Explore:** Ideate concepts, apply TRIZ, perform DOE.  
4. **Develop:** Conduct detailed design, robust and reliability analysis.  
5. **Implement:** Prototype, pilot, control, and rollout.

## Deliverables
- Project Charter and MGPP docs.  
- Data analysis reports and control charts.  
- DOE and simulation results.  
- Prototype/pilot evaluation.  
- Final implementation plan and handover materials.

## Presentation
Prepare a 15-minute presentation covering:
- Problem statement and goals.  
- Key findings and data analysis.  
- Selected solution and validation results.  
- Implementation roadmap and control plan.

## Summary
The capstone validates mastery of DMEDI and equips Black Belts to lead transformative projects in their organizations.
